**Task33: Create `BrushManager` in Qt**
*   Task: Create `BrushManager` using Qt's `QObject` system for creation and management. Implement `createBrush()`, mirroring the type mapping using Brush::Type for internal brush creation. Replace wx events with Qt Signals for selected/created. If `Brush` has internal state change, use signals for tracking like the wxWidgets signals Brush::changed (for Item properties updates that should trigger display reloads, for Brush sizes which are set by View events on Mapview for direct Brush config in editor, as well as specific case in Flood Fill like Fill target set when its triggered by RMB to initiate what to replace from MapView using `BrushManager::getInstance()->UpdateFloodFillTargets()` to indicate which `Item`'s are selected from currentTile context rather than from direct Item* stored by the `Brush` as this usually only refers to fill items if currentBrush is a Flood Fill when creating `ClearItemCommands` which should take the list from Brush to clear all relevant from target, either one from internal buffer passed from a click/area-select by MouseRelease like standard Brush implements `fillWithCurrentPattern` to erase using `currentItem`, but FloodFill likely maintains the condition for checking when not at startPos like checking if any relevant in tile->items before adding/removing for currentItem like the base logic.
`UpdateCurrentBrushTargetType()`, `SetLastSelectedTiles` seems to have a purpose on paste-to action on `tilesToDraw` and what to initially replace from Map on Tile paste.
