**Task54: Finalize Item Rendering (Integrate Sprites - Full Sprite Sheet & Animation Handling)**
- Task: **Implement full, production-quality sprite integration for `Item` rendering. This means `Item::draw()` must now correctly use `GameSprite`s (Task 27) and `SpriteManager` (Task 35) to draw the entire visual structure of items based on their type, properties, and animation state, respecting layers and drawing options.**
    - **Analyze Existing Rendering:** Build upon `Item::draw()` (Task 13/22) and `GameSprite` (Task 27) from `Project_QT/src`.
    - **`Item::draw()` Full Implementation:**
        -   When `Item::draw(QPainter* painter, ...)` is called (by `Tile::draw()`), it must:
            -   Determine the correct `GameSprite` for this `Item` (e.g., by querying `SpriteManager` with its `ItemID` or `ItemType`).
            -   If the `Item` is animated, get the current animation frame from its `GameSprite` (which uses its `Animator`).
            -   Call `theGameSprite->drawTo(painter, targetRectOnTile, sourceRectFromSpriteSheet, currentFrame, ...)` to render the item.
            -   Handle sprite layers correctly if an item consists of multiple stacked sprites (e.g., an outfit with addons, a creature with equipment) or if its rendering is affected by `Tile` layers.
    - **Sprite Information Access:** Ensure `Item` can access all necessary sprite information (offsets, dimensions, animation details) either through its `ItemType` data (loaded by `ItemManager`) or directly from the `GameSprite` obtained via `SpriteManager`.
    - **Integration with `MapTileItem` Caching:** `Item::draw()` is called by `Tile::draw()`, which in turn is called by `MapTileItem::paint()`. If `MapTileItem` caches its rendering to a `QPixmap` (Task 23), this full item sprite rendering will be part of that cache. `drawTilesContentToCache` (if this is a `MapView` method) needs to ensure all visible items are drawn correctly to this cache.
    - **Zoom-Based Filtering/LOD (if applicable):** If specific items or item details should not be rendered at certain zoom levels (as per `DrawingOptions` or `ItemType` properties), implement this filtering logic within `Item::draw()` or before calling it.
    - **Wall & Floor Rendering:** This task also implies that items representing walls, floors, and other map structures now render using their proper sprites, not placeholders.
    - **`Task54.md` must specify how `ItemType` data maps to `GameSprite` IDs/animations, any layering rules for composite item sprites, and how original rendering handled different visual states of items (e.g., open/closed containers, on/off lights).**
