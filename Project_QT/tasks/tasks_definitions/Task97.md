**Task97: Integrate Application Settings and Preferences (Persistence)**
- Task: Migrate and complete remaining `SettingsManager`/g_settings features (any config data, like screen resolution, those related to special states which Brush implementations had or DrawingOptions might determine which sprites are loaded/unloaded, palette layout, brush shapes). Ensure correct read/save paths using a new cross-platform solution in qt6 to save those states or load those initial settings from configuration (`g_settings::load`, save) where appropriate and needed using wxWidgets config settings or file-paths as guidance (`lastXXX`/load) in Project_QT unless those where only defaults, migrating those with proper Qt type (`QVariant`) for any configuration as they do data format conversions rather than a new dedicated parser for each config in its sections. These should then ensure all `palette` or brush creation/display functions/states now use settings when reloading similar to the border auto-magic mode that wx already had.  Include functionality if it only triggers redraw at certain panels/windows but a specific state gets updated via main window properties. Ensure consistent default initialization across all controls like similar classes (`MapCanvas` for tooltips and whether to show special items similar to `highlightItems`, border system properties if needed when not all of those properties for every Automagic/brush-like tool have no setting like BORDER\_XXX might have as ItemProperty now for that). This involves ensuring that when these g_settings have or might now cause some items/tilesets/layers or visual effects/cached maps (minimap if that manages loading/update using existing maps tile and state properties rather than generating now a different image/sprite rather than tile color as preview) update and call to the proper function to draw rather than MapCanvas directly querying g_settings on its update. Similarly maintain if anything related to palette and its visibility, style is restored based on what g_settings now should use in mainWindow and other panels if they manage layout now using those like for wx main\_frame or window settings during main windows startup like SHOW_TOOLBAR or LAYOUT where no method yet in QT exists but it should have similar function call in CreateUI for toolbar states when any such setting affects both `GUI`-view-properties and a property on those palette windows/similar classes rather than keeping just static if visibility state doesn't change. Add support if QBrush/drawing using a specific border in QT had or needs access to a generic or named `CustomBrush`, which previously likely would require explicit selection for an ID.
