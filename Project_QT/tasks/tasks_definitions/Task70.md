**Task70: Finish `Tileset` implementations (Creating Visual Panels for Tile, Ground, Doodad etc. in `MainPalette`)**
- Task: **Based on the `TilesetManager` (Task 67), create the actual visual UI panels within the `MainPalette` (or appropriate `QDockWidget`) for displaying different `Tileset` categories (e.g., "Ground Tiles," "Wall Tiles," "Doodads," "Items," "Creatures"). These panels will allow users to select specific items or brushes for use on the map.**
    - **Analyze Existing Palette UI:** Review `Project_QT/src`'s `MainPalette` and any existing item/brush selection panels.
    - **Panel Structure within `MainPalette`:**
        -   The `MainPalette` will likely be a `QTabWidget` or similar, with each tab representing a major `Tileset` category (e.g., a "Terrain" tab, an "Items" tab).
        -   Each tab/panel will contain UI elements to display the items/brushes belonging to that category, populated from `TilesetManager`.
    - **Displaying Items/Brushes:**
        -   Use `QListWidget` with icons, `QListView` with a custom model, or a grid of `ItemButton`s (from Task 31/47, now enhanced to display actual `Item` previews or `GameSprite`s) to show the selectable elements in each panel.
        -   For each item/brush displayed, show its visual representation (icon/sprite) and potentially its name or ID.
    - **Populating Panels:**
        -   On startup or when `TilesetManager` is initialized, iterate through its categories. For each category, create a tab/panel in `MainPalette` and populate it with the corresponding items/brushes retrieved from `TilesetManager::getItemsInCategory()` or `getBrushTypesInCategory()`.
        -   This replaces original `wxItems.cpp` `tileset create method` logic if that was about UI population, not just data definition.
    - **Interaction and Selection:**
        -   When a user clicks an item/brush in one of these panels:
            -   The `MainPalette` should signal to `BrushManager` to set this as the active brush (e.g., `brushManager->setActiveBrush(selectedBrushType, selectedItemID)`).
            -   Visually highlight the selected item/brush in the panel.
    - **Handling View Updates (if original did):** If the `wxwidgets` main window events (e.g., map loaded, filter changed) caused these palette panels to update or filter their contents, implement stubs for these update mechanisms (e.g., slots in `MainPalette` connected to `MainWindow` signals).
    - **`g_materials` Logic:** If `g_materials` from `wxwidgets` not only defined categories but also how items within those categories were presented or filtered in the UI, port that presentation logic here. If original `tileSets` were very simple (e.g., just "RAW" tile items without deep categorization), then `MainPalette` might have fewer specialized tabs and more direct item browsing, but the `TilesetManager` should still allow for this if new categories are defined.
    - **Brush/Item Property Display:** Consider how selecting an item in this palette might trigger a display of its properties in a separate `ItemPropertyEditor` panel (conceptual link for now).
    - **`Task70.md` needs to detail the UI structure of the original brush/item palettes in `wxwidgets` (e.g., tab names, how items were displayed), how categories from `g_materials` mapped to these UI elements, and any filtering or dynamic update logic within these palettes. It also needs to clarify how `Brush` objects were "created" or "configured" when an item was selected from such a palette to become the active drawing tool.**
