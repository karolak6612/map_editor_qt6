**Task70: Finish Tileset implementations like creating visual panels for Tile, Ground**
tiles and similar in mainPalette, handling view updates (if these had any from the main window events similar to other palettes for which BrushPalettePanel implementation exists) based on the `wxItems.cpp` tileset create method if thats no longer in Materials but there is still a way for Palettes to handle which should be part of that tileset for each tile/doodad item from brushes (`addToTileset`) based on its types when a brush is converted/added.  If no more `tileSets`, simplify into regular palette panels by creating an empty list, and if it's only tile items (`RAW`, rather than categories/tilesets in g\_materials) and the new Brushes that specify where they appear by Item type rather than if item belongs to certain group as this will decide both which properties these display and which brush can set which `items`, or Tiles/`TilesetPanel`/similar will then get additional properties based on items as in earlier steps to display in view/update or if it simply sets which one is currently active during edit/add using new signal system or via property like similar in other special tilesets (`setGround`), replacing wxWidgets usage where some events directly created or copied `tilesets` with all items using its data to set/clean brushes which is done through `Items/Materials` rather than specific Tiles if Tileset has internal list or if some `Tileset`/`Brushes` implementations still check/add items from Brush type properties.
