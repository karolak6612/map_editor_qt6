**Task85: Implement Tile Locking Mechanism (Data Model, UI Actions, `MapView` Interaction)**
- Task: **Migrate the tile locking mechanism and associated actions that manipulate tilemap states. This involves updating the internal `Map` data representation to include a lock status for tiles, and creating UI elements and `MapView` interactions to allow users to lock/unlock tiles, preventing accidental modification. Update `QGraphicsItems` to reflect lock status and respect it during interactions.**
    - **Analyze Existing Locking Logic:** Review `Project_QT/src` for any existing tile protection or locking features.
    - **`Map` Data Model Update:**
        -   Add a property to the `Tile` class (e.g., `bool m_isLocked;`) or a `TileFlag` to represent its locked state.
        -   Provide `Tile::isLocked() const` and `Tile::setLocked(bool locked)` methods.
    - **UI Actions for Locking/Unlocking:**
        -   Add `QAction`s (e.g., "Lock Tile(s)," "Unlock Tile(s)") to the main menu (e.g., Edit or Map menu) and/or the `MapView`'s right-click context menu.
        -   These actions should operate on the current tile selection (`Selection` object from Task 17).
    - **Command Implementation (Undoable):**
        -   Create `LockTilesCommand` and `UnlockTilesCommand` (inheriting from `QUndoCommand`).
        -   `redo()`: Iterates the selected `Tile`s and calls `tile->setLocked(true/false)`.
        -   `undo()`: Reverts the locked state.
    - **`MapView` Interaction:**
        -   All brush operations and selection modification tools in `MapView` must now check `tile->isLocked()` before attempting to modify a `Tile`. If locked, the modification should be prevented (potentially with user feedback like a status bar message).
    - **Visual Indication:**
        -   `MapTileItem::paint()` should visually indicate if a tile is locked (e.g., draw a lock icon overlay, change its border color, reduce opacity of content slightly). This visual state should update when `Tile::setLocked()` is called.
    - **`SelectionBox` Logic (`SetSelection`):** If the original `selection.h` / `SetSelection` logic interacted with tile locking (e.g., couldn't select locked tiles for modification), port this behavior. However, `MapViews` event/signal flow on tile click (which now might change the active brush if that's the interaction from `Task80.md`) needs to consider tile lock status *before* initiating a brush change or selection box operation that would modify, unless specific selection operations are performed from a popup menu after `MapView` already determined the tile can be acted upon.
    - **Item Edit Menu (`copyPosition`):** Ensure any context menu entries for items (e.g., "Copy Position") on locked tiles are appropriately disabled or respect the lock.
    - **`Task85.md` needs to describe how tile locking was implemented in `wxwidgets` (data storage, UI elements), how it affected `SelectionBox` or other tools, and the visual cues for locked tiles.**
