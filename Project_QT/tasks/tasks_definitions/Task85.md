**Task85: Implement Tile Locking Mechanism**
- Migrate tile locking and associated actions that manipulate the tilemap states, updating internal representation (Map data), as well as QGraphicsItems from which theres visibility and interactivity in scene via flags/selection. This might include functions from selection.h which handle or implement the selectionBox (`SetSelection`) and related tile properties now based on Item types in map rather than individual selected Tiles' data and the Selection state from wx if there no longer specific select operations done by mouse but MapViews event/signal if a particular Tile gets clicked to change brush rather than from a selectionBox object when an edit operation (like rotate) takes place from popup, if the new MouseClick functions only propagate mouse position, event and floor unless something specific updates `MapView`. Ensure item edit menu entries exist like copyPosition when clicking from item list/similar for actions to show dialog when requested.
