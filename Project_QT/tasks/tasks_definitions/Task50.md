**Task50: Implement `ReplaceItemsDialog` UI (Find Similar - Full UI, Placeholder Backend)**
- Task: **Implement the user interface for the "Find Similar Items" / "Replace Items" functionality. This involves creating a `QDialog` (e.g., `ReplaceItemsDialog` or `FindSimilarDialog`) in `project_qt` that allows users to define item properties for searching and rules for replacement, similar to `wxWidgets::ReplaceItemsDialog`. Focus on the UI layout and widget creation; backend logic is stubbed.**
    - **Analyze Existing UI:** Review any related find/replace dialogs in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Dialog UI Creation:**
        -   Design and implement the `QDialog` UI. This should include:
            -   Controls for specifying criteria to find items (e.g., fields for Item ID, name fragments, checkboxes for flags like `isMoveable`, `isBlocking`, drop-downs for `ItemType`).
            -   Controls for specifying what to replace the found items with (e.g., another Item ID, option to delete).
            -   Buttons like "Find," "Replace Selected," "Replace All."
            -   Possibly a results area (e.g., a `QListWidget` to show found items/tiles - placeholder population for now).
    - **Interaction with `ItemPropertyEditor` (Conceptual):**
        -   The dialog might include a button or mechanism (as in original `popup_menu` on items) to open an `ItemPropertyEditor` (Task 45 stub) to help define the properties of the item to find or replace with. For this task, such a button would just try to show the stub editor.
    - **Backend Logic (Stubs):**
        -   Connect dialog buttons (Find, Replace All) to placeholder slots within the dialog or a controller class. These slots should log the action and the criteria entered by the user.
        -   No actual item searching on the `Map` or item replacement logic is implemented in this task.
    - **Data Flow:** The dialog should gather search parameters from its UI elements. The "replacement rule" definition part is also just UI at this stage. If the original dialog directly modified a selection, that interaction needs to be conceptually noted.
    - **Separate Tool/Command:** This functionality is initially a standalone dialog/tool. Integration into `MainMenuBar` or context menus comes later.
    - **`Task50.md` is critical for detailing the exact UI layout of the original `ReplaceItemsDialog`, all its input fields, search options, replacement options, and how it presented results or interacted with map selections in `wxwidgets`.**
