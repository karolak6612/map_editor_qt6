**Task50: Implement ReplaceItemsDialog (Find Similar)**
-   Task: Implement "Find Similar Items" functionality. Focus on creating a dialog for defining replacement rules based on item properties (similar to wxWidgets' `ReplaceItemsDialog`). It would take the selection data and from there open itemPropertiesEditor (via a button or other methods used before in popup\_menu on items) or if that wasn't the same as editing Items attributes just mirror its existing search operations via wxwidgets version in a simple UI that gets parameters from the initial properties display and generates a result which ideally would be a set of Tiles as before that get replaced when user hits a confirmation like 'Replace All' that ideally uses Selection system like how original intended rather than iterating a result window. At first make this functionality a separate tool/command, directly applying replacements to all selected or filtering to those found by similar. Handle integration to MainMenuBar via commands later if needed or it had entries in other places (menus, toolbars).
