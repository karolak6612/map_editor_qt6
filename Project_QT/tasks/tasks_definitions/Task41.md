**Task41: Implement `AutoBorder` class structure in Qt (Data Representation for Borders)**
- Task: **Implement the `AutoBorder` class in `project_qt`. This class is used by brushes like `GroundBrush` (and the `BorderSystem` later) to represent and manage the properties of automatically generated border items on Tiles.**
    - **Analyze Existing Border Logic:** Review any existing border-related data structures or logic in `Project_QT/src` to ensure the new `AutoBorder` class integrates well or replaces them appropriately.
    - **Core Data Members:** The `AutoBorder` class must store all necessary information to define a border segment, including:
        -   `border_type`: An enum or int representing the type of border (e.g., horizontal, vertical, inner corner, outer corner, single piece). This should map directly from the original `EDGE_*` definitions (e.g., `EDGE_HORIZONTAL`, `EDGE_VERTICAL_UP`). Convert these original `EDGE_*` enums to a Qt `enum class`.
        -   `border_item_id`: The specific client item ID that represents this visual border piece. This ID should be assignable and retrievable.
        -   Associated `ground_item_id` (or `ground_type`): The ID or type of the ground tile this border is associated with (e.g., sand border vs. grass border), as borders might differ visually or functionally based on adjacent ground. This is important for correctly selecting border items, especially if a border is between two different ground types (e.g., "sand vs. non-sand").
        -   Pointers or references to the `Tile` objects involved in this border if `AutoBorder` represents a relationship between two tiles, or if `tiles` stored actual IDs of borders (as original `brushes_tables.cpp` might have to set these IDs for border item assignment).
    - **Methods:**
        -   Constructors to create `AutoBorder` objects.
        -   Getters and setters for all its properties.
        -   Potentially, a method like `List<Item*> getBorderItemsToPlace(Map* map)` which, given the border type and ground context, would return a list of `Item`s (or their IDs) that need to be placed on the `Tile` to render this border (this method's implementation may initially be a stub that returns placeholder IDs).
    - **Error Handling and ID Lookup:** When setting `border_item_id` or `ground_item_id`, ensure appropriate error handling or validation is considered if bad Item IDs are provided, especially during unserialization operations or conversion of edge properties where a lookup for a valid `ItemType` ID might be needed. This task primarily defines the structure; full validation hooks into `ItemManager` later.
    - **`Task41.md` is essential and must provide the full original `EDGE_*` enum definitions, how `borderItem` was mapped to item IDs, how ground equivalency affected border selection, and any other properties the original `AutoBorder` concept managed (e.g., from `brushes_tables.cpp` implementation or XML representations).**
