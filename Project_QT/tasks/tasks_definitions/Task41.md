**Task41: Implement `AutoBorder` in Qt**
- Implement the AutoBorder in `project_qt` (used by `GroundBrush`, should also include conversion or lookup for how the EDGE\_* defines, from enums to int/string mappings) as the way of representing borders on Tiles ensuring correct border type assignment (horizontal/vertical), borderItem should be mapped to an itemid and if there was some generic placeholder before make Item/Tileset manage it at load time rather than Brush creating something invalid which usually might be based on Tile or neighboring Tiles content rather than internal attribute from XML on load that might fail in an `unserialize()` operation (or similarly ensure appropriate error handling for bad Item type ID lookup when converting edge properties on this new AutoBorder like earlier versions when brush placement implied those were tiles and got directly added as items from the surrounding locations); maintain `ground` and any related properties if border was for an equivalent tile (sand vs non sand); `tiles` store actual id of borders (which get used in getItems method if implemented by that border or generally how `brushes_tables.cpp` implemented to set those ids for border item assignment).
