**Task1: Migrate `wxImage` to `QImage`**
-  Task: Replace all instances of `wxImage` with `QImage` in `project_qt`. Ensure all image loading, manipulation, and saving operations are performed using `QImage`. Update affected code to handle `QImage` objects correctly. Focus: `SpriteManager`, `ItemManager`, `ResourceManager`.
