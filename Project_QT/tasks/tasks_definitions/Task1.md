**Task1: Migrate `wxImage` to `QImage`**
- Task: **Systematically replace all instances and usages of `wxImage` with `QImage` throughout the `project_qt` codebase.**
    - **Analyze Existing Code:** Before modification, thoroughly examine any existing `Project_QT/src` code that already uses `QImage` or performs image handling. Ensure your new work is consistent with existing Qt patterns, or refactor existing code where necessary to align with a unified `QImage`-based approach.
    - **Functional Parity:** Ensure all image loading (from all file formats previously supported by `wxImage`), manipulation (e.g., scaling with various quality options, format conversions between image types, direct pixel access methods like `GetData()`, `SetData()`, `GetAlpha()`, `SetAlpha()`, `SetRGB()`), and saving operations previously performed using `wxImage` are now achieved with `QImage`. Maintain full functional and visual fidelity, including metadata, color profiles, and alpha channel handling.
    - **Update Affected Code:** All C++ code (classes, methods, functions) that previously instantiated, passed, returned, or otherwise interacted with `wxImage` objects must be updated to correctly use `QImage` objects. This includes careful mapping of `wxImage` API calls to their `QImage` equivalents.
    - **Focus Areas (as specified in original `Task1.md`):** Pay particular and meticulous attention to the `SpriteManager`, `ItemManager`, and `ResourceManager` classes. Analyze their original `wxImage` usage in `wxwidgets` and ensure their internal logic, public interfaces, and any image caching mechanisms are correctly and completely adapted to use `QImage` in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Deliverable:** This is a foundational graphics migration task. The outcome must be a `project_qt` codebase where `QImage` is used exclusively and correctly in all places `wxImage` was previously employed, with no degradation of image-related functionality. **Refer to `Task1.md` for any specific API mapping guidelines or critical image processing routines that must be preserved.**
