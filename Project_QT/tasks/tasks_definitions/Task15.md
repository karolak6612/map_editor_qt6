**Task15: Create Basic `Creature` Class in Qt (Data, Accessors, Sprite Forward Declaration)**
- Task: **Migrate the `Creature` class itself to `project_qt`, mirroring its fundamental structure, core functionalities, basic setters/getters for attributes (name, health, speed, lookType, outfit details, etc.), as defined in `wxwidgets::creature.cpp/h`.**
    - **Analyze Existing Code:** Integrate with or refactor any existing `Creature` class in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Data Members & Accessors:** Ensure all essential data members from the `wx` version are present in the Qt `Creature` class. Implement corresponding public getter and setter methods. It is critical that data like `lookType` (if this changes on an instance-by-instance basis per creature) is correctly stored and modifiable.
    - **Sprite Access (Placeholder):** For sprite access, include only forward declarations for `SpriteManager` or `GameSprite` types. Actual sprite objects or full integration with `SpriteManager` will occur after `GameSprite` (Task 27) is more developed. An `Outfit*` or `lookType` member might point to data structures for visual representation later.
    - **Dependent Functionality:** Implement methods with placeholder effects if their original logic depends on classes or systems not yet fully migrated into `project_qt` (e.g., if a method tried to draw the creature or interact with a game system).
    - **No Actual Sprite Rendering:** This task does not involve rendering the creature.
    - **`Task15.md` provides the definitive list of member variables and method signatures from `wxwidgets::creature.cpp/h` that must be ported to the Qt `Creature` class.**
