**Task82: Migrate and Enhance Search Functionality (Including Replace/Find)**
-   Task: Enhance search functionality for Items, including 'Find All' (all instances of an Item by ID or Name or Properties via dialog and the appropriate `itemTypes`) creating dedicated replace-style functions/commands in `project_qt` rather than just showing a result dialog for which main\_menubar methods exists similar to those related cleanup-selection which had "find tiles/replace items if criteria matched". Implement basic search via main menu action, using FindItemDialog's item search function now, including both Server/Client ID/Names, also by ItemType as its attribute/Type. Also create specific Item removal method rather than doing generic Map-level filtering based on similar when there was functions in `wxSelection`/item classes when manipulating the Tiles (`replaceItems` should only contain items and which one to swap, but no actions/cleanup itself and similar function that applies the changelist on all matched similar to how copybuffer-`replaceTileData` worked using items directly to merge using now new QT items commands if a batch edit like drag replace for many is preferred, with additional signals for update like `itemChanged`). Integrate ignored list from wx if needed in Property Editor like similar functions which read item states directly and then return an action, or similar logic to `clear_items_dialog`/tiles selection state for mass edit rather than removing just any item type of X like was done using finder function in earlier versions via foreach. Maintain as much as feasible those search mode enums for property checks in FindSimilar as both `TilePropertyWindow` and `MapRemoveDuplicatesDialog`/replaceItem used to decide what to remove/which similar from tiles list, using now Items->itemTypes instead with find methods rather than Item directly setting whether its IsMovable/Blocking/or canDoX based on map or flags/ID ranges that the new brush properties likely maintain, for `TilePropertyPanel`/replace rather than for properties dialog as a different approach to similar search/replace (where both the criteria and where to apply is read once rather than from Selection mode/tile where that dialog then has no access to if not a child of the current active `mapView`/palette when selecting items/tiles unless it queries tile locations in multiple tiles again by type, potentially triggering undo/redraw via any method from Tile now if necessary from find, set like when borderize did similar). The replace-related UI updates ideally need something like searchResults using selection changes to update those in PropertyDock and elsewhere like status bar as a Map operation if find similar modifies map state now too like `ItemsEditor`. Migrate text based conversion functions similar to findItems/parseItemsInFile method for converting and checking which one it gets similar to house\_exit conversion based on town names from wx house list.
