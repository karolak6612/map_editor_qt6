**Task82: Migrate and Enhance Search Functionality (Full `FindItemDialog`, "Find All", Replace Logic & `ItemTypes` Integration)**
- Task: **Fully implement and enhance search functionality for `Item`s within the map, building upon the `FindItemDialog` UI (Task 68). This includes implementing "Find All" (listing all instances of an item matching criteria), and robust replace-style functions/commands that operate on `ItemType`s and item attributes. This replaces and potentially extends any existing find/replace methods from `wxwidgets main_menubar` or selection cleanup logic.**
    - **Analyze Existing Search Code:** Review `Project_QT/src`'s `FindItemDialog` and any backend item searching logic.
    - **Backend Search Logic (in `ItemManager` or `MapSearcher`):**
        -   Implement the actual search algorithms (stubs from Task 68) that take `SearchCriteria` (from `FindItemDialog`) and query the `Map`'s `Tile`s and `Item`s.
        -   Search by: Server/Client ID, Item Name (partial/exact), `ItemType` (from its attribute or specific Type property, not just ID ranges), other attributes (`isMoveable`, `isBlocking`, custom attributes).
    - **"Find All" Functionality:**
        -   When "Find All" is triggered from `FindItemDialog`, populate its results list/view with all `Item`s (or `Tile`s containing them) that match the criteria. The results list should display key item info and allow selection.
    - **Replace Functionality (as `QUndoCommand`s):**
        -   Implement dedicated `ReplaceItemCommand` (or similar) for replacing found items.
        -   Options should include: replacing with another `ItemID` (and its default `ItemType` properties), or replacing specific attributes.
        -   This command must be undoable and should correctly modify `Item`s on `Tile`s within the `Map`.
        -   `FindItemDialog` might have "Replace Selected in List" or "Replace All Matching in Map" buttons.
    - **`ItemTypes` Integration:** Searches should now use `Items->itemTypes` (from `ItemManager`) to determine properties like `IsMovable`, `IsBlocking`, `CanDoX`, rather than relying on ID ranges or hardcoded `Item` flags if these have been migrated to `ItemType` definitions or `Item` attributes.
    - **Scope of Replace:** Clarify if "replace" operates on the whole map based on find criteria, or only on items currently listed in the search results, or on the current `MapSelection` (if `wxSelection`/item classes previously had specific `replaceItems` for selected tiles). The goal is a flexible but clear replace scope.
    - **Text-Based Conversions (`findItems`/`parseItemsInFile`):** If original functions like `findItems` or `parseItemsInFile` performed text-based conversions for item identification or property setting (e.g., `house_exit` conversion based on town names from `wx` house list), port this logic to be usable by the search/replace system if relevant.
    - **UI Updates:** Found items or tiles containing them might need to be highlighted or navigated to in `MapView`. Selection changes in the results list should update any linked property editors (`PropertyDock`) or the `StatusBar`. If a replace operation modifies the map, full UI/`MapView` refresh signals must be emitted.
    - **Original Search Mode Enums:** Maintain the spirit of original search mode enums (if any were used in `FindSimilar`, `TilePropertyWindow`, `MapRemoveDuplicatesDialog`) that dictated what to remove/which similar items from a tile list, but adapt them to use the new `ItemType` system and attribute-based finding methods rather than direct `Item` flag checks.
    - **`Task82.md` must define the original search criteria options exhaustively, how "Find All" and various "Replace" scopes worked, any text parsing/conversion logic, how `ItemTypes` were used in original searches, and the interaction with UI for results display and actions.**
