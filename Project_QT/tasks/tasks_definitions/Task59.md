**Task59: Create Item Finders to replace functionality.**
- Implement TileFinder using Tile-Item logic to provide efficient Tile item searching by criteria like attributes from the current `ItemType`, ID from Brush, to replace what wx used via Tile->`XXXBrush`/XXXEquivalent methods when searching for or adding items by properties in Tile, adding all possible lookup conditions as in findItems method (with find*Brush). Focus `Tile`, `Items`. Implement appropriate functions/logic using the available data structures as a more focused approach when each specific item type knows where/in what Tile slot its associated Items are to check. For the general use like in Map->`cleanDuplicateItems`/cleanInvalid, implement with iterator pattern on items in range, providing data like the map itself and count or current if those were needed to report progress in TileItem based removal similar to the foreach\_* or if replacing with a different one (`transformItem`, and its update using wxImage), to clean all or filter via remove condition on the same Tiles/Items rather than doing multiple lookups across different layers based on whats stored by ItemManager and BrushType/`itemType` (e.g. ground tiles vs ground, etc.) now when adding/clearing Items during operations (`tile->addItem(new Tile::items vector to construct` after tile or map operation as tiles and their data determine current properties/visuals). Maintain any helpers used to determine a Tile's properties/ItemType if the tile drawing requires both (internal item data for correct visualization order by property and Tile/ItemProperty information which determine their general "placeability" from BorderSystems like checks on tiles for can\_border) as well as handling which layer each goes into if items were set according to Brush/ItemType from there rather than having every case in Tiles and any specific Item functions handling what tile attribute it should set or when something needs to check them rather than Item/ItemProperty access via `Map`/TileItem if the tile now would keep those too to prevent recalculation like before as there would no longer multiple calls checking that the currently set or other layers ground type match or whether something should replace (withBrush) or that is similar but is done only in a small range of position at `wallItem`/border item placement if not having `MapTileItems` call them each frame and Item has similar getter properties than a tiles. If some actions or conditions previously set using multiple Tile level attribute like MapFlags, zoneIds move what needs it in that particular function as Item properties as not having each action set on any map event as a single general check/function doing that and when setting/unsettin multiple similar flags, for instance ensuring flags on each `tile`/item have all available parameters for `TileProperties` if thats easier as those flags were from single TileLocations/items on that specific tile which Tile might cache but items were created using different types on tile->`xxxize()` and those set individual property flags, maintaining previous compatibility as Tile still has direct access (e.g. tile-`isPZ()`) or methods like hasProperty as the old API would require on Tile itself but without constantly setting that state if some properties of a tile might only change when other objects get placed on map in a tile like creature related states or tiles getting converted when adding items (`wall_item` using its wall flag, similar to isGround in `brush->draw` etc where there was some logic and properties now need setting Tile's appropriate members and states directly or via attributes, to support existing map format like the new `OTBM` reader/parser`).  Create general structure in Tile and implement its draw/property helper functions now using proper types similar to get\*Brush if necessary where each brush's "isX" state got moved as part of its `itemType` now when the type might get read multiple times if tile has that brush or an equivalent for items, even when these `Item` might have different position, visibility, or if item rendering should have different offsets via properties, height like in the wxWidget map drawers `tile::getItemRenderLayer`, where Item determines now how it renders but Tile holds only position/grid slot at that position (where there may be multiple Items but ground should be on first position only and `hasGround()` returns if theres any Tile item in Tile class that is the 'background' rather than item check), passing DrawingOptions or the new `map_canvas::MapRenderingParams`/options as relevant context in Item render, since thats what tile items (`graphics items in qt`) will receive for display state updates and Tile/item selection no longer directly handles setting it like it would for older mapviews and how its states affected drawing using Selection in wxWidgets editor.
