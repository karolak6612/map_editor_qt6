**Task76: Finish Graphics/Sprite/Rendering Integration**
Final drawing code including proper layer support to handle any special cases not covered previously (those Item flags set based on current selection type when that state/mode was switched for the tile and that needs also sending an event like the new Action created does to make Tile-level changes have all data to check what Items/Brushes to draw on them rather than requiring multiple loops and Item access using its attributes if the tileset or view style only implies what Brushes a certain tileset uses like ground having specific borders) for all remaining cases now where these were not done before, like updating internal sprite id setting from getItemClient and actual drawing the Tile-selected or selectedItem when an Item is being dragged or if Tiles needs these special display methods when selected like what doors used based on `wall_items` as their selection changed state triggered similar drawing event when there's an update but not direct map modification, even when something does add/modify tiles internally on selection. Similarly for drawing on empty/valid items in new `drawBrushIndicator`. This also include other functions using OpenGL as Sprite manager had its implementation there (`TakeScreenshot`, the various calls drawing tiles in LightDrawer using QT style functions now when rendering lights/updating MapCanvas display on light level/position changes if relevant and possible using qt framework.) 
Adjust where appropriate if `Map::LoadVersion`/create uses some information, states from brush (was from palettes selected brush data) using Qt specific item drawing methods similar to Item/`hasAttribute`/`TileMapFlags`, etc if required during display for example if Brush now determines what kind or size marker or selection rectangle for that items (tile/house based cursor sizes for selection border etc., any special icon from Item's properties or `BrushCategory` itself like with the wall hooks or tiles if these do their drawing without an item but `DrawingOptions` defines tile/item or only visible border types for example) now when rendering if Map/Item properties changed after creating the item or similarly tile using internal draw for background has any visibility state using DrawingOptions as the new items handle display in a similar manner for different draw operations rather than all at create-time for which the older tile class likely set flags to update if there is for instance `drawXXXInfo`.
