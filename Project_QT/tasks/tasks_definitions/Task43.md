**Task43: Migrate `CarpetBrush`**
- Implement `CarpetBrush` using data directly read on `createBrush` using `Brushes::loadBrush` rather than special carpet creation and setting parameters like for the GroundBrush as in wxWidgets versions as those categories now simply refer to a tileset (Palette type for selecting currentItem based on Brush types selected there), adjusting to other Brush behaviour in `project_qt`, implementing basic Draw to return what seems to have been inlined logic for setting the carpet items similar to what Door brush might set a specific item type rather than the base like how DoorBrush has direct ID stored that then changes on place/undraw with wall/door type. The wall tile creation method has multiple forms using only GroundBrush ID if thats an explicit border rather than wall which also should allow checking similar data via Brush type for any "BorderBrush" now in `tile->cleanBorders()` using BorderBlocks::autoBorder in tile calculation where applicable and consistent with newer designs. Implement/port getCarpet methods or add required methods/signals if MapView/Tileset use those to check Tile state for update before setting `carpetBrush`, while ensuring current configuration on mapview if its visible from other layers is properly passed to set on creation or when setting a tile so new Tile/items do not contain out of view floors/positions which seem possible in Wx implementation (`GetCursorPosition()`) for relative/actual coordinates which then affects how or if `add/remove*Item` calls signal back a changed tile if location wasn't visible like in previous examples if those do updates for those cases, but not clearing or overriding the whole view in Map display at tiles when not editing or something triggers an item update which has those cases separated on wxwidgets Tile if Map or `MapScene` in `project_qt` versions handle the tile redraw.
