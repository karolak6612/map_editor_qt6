**Task88: Create `ProgressDialog` using QProgressDialog and adapt usages**
(those like MapView had). For any wx version which might now just post directly after each process step in place, convert with threads using events/emit signals after a delay or based on current processing chunks if needed and if its meant for user feedback of some operation taking time using progress on MapViews or MainWindow rather than via individual component setting load scale each loop now directly in UI from Map functions doing operations on Tile::Items via its lists unless a dedicated load handler or Editor/selection level actions provide a similar state when converting maps as there were those functions. Update if some Map method no longer reports done at Map but rather `onTileUpdated`, tile draw triggers events based on what changes after drawing has taken place, as any drawing operation now triggers the new tiles to get processed to set those internal flags for example (`modify`).
