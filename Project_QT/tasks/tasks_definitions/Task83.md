**Task83: Enhance Rendering: LOD, Lighting, Transparency**
. 

  - Implement LOD and lighting with an optional "Shade" visualization similar to what the original editor offered, with configurable thresholds using wx's lod_manager.h LOD type if any or simply int mapping of drawing settings (zoom rather than distance if not maintaining view parameters when updating rendering logic in Draw), making tiles and their appearance at far distances (as well any specialized items from a collection based brush or similar type, like those related to shadows) using a property now similar to how its `itemType`/TileProperty managed that to toggle visual state/draw rather than these Brushes directly having that in an override where its the tile rather that uses flags or layer in items using similar logic that DrawingOptions checks in older `TileItem::paint`/map_drawer but not constantly creating items from brush on Tile based drawing or needing all items as some have rendering or z level calculation similar to house selection mode markers at every draw but a specific item determines when and where to get placed similar to way optional borders used a flag for placing gravel in addition to the new wall and other special property items unless having tile also provide its own tile or Item based attributes using existing logic now rather than a separate list of objects with specific properties, e.g., `HouseExits` which `TilesetHouse` keeps internally for editing) and which sprites rather than just the generic 32x32 for these when determining which one should not be rendered at draw by what are now only `DrawingOptions` or the QGraphicsViews item properties. Similarly when applying transparency with zoom now for some `TileItems`/other elements if tiles need explicit hasAlpha/opacity from what are typically Item or game-sprite's layer-related graphics states (like those on Sprites or DrawingOptions that Tile draws from for the visible Items now or ItemTypes/brush states) if theres any rather than a type based `show_all_floors` (with only the tiles themselves being more or less transparent if not using sprite sheets that already handle visibility) for tile properties on all map view like drawing tile bounds via OpenGL using Qt specific types for which MapTileItem had methods.
