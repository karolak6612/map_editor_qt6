**Task83: Enhance Rendering: LOD, Lighting Effects, Transparency (Full Visual Feature Parity)**
- Task: **Implement advanced rendering features: Level of Detail (LOD) for sprites/items, lighting effects (if applicable), and comprehensive transparency handling, aiming for visual parity with what the original `wxwidgets` editor offered, especially features configurable via `lod_manager.h` or similar drawing settings.**
    - **Analyze Existing Rendering Features:** Review `Project_QT/src` for current LOD, lighting, or advanced transparency.
    - **Level of Detail (LOD):**
        -   Implement logic for rendering `Item`s or `GameSprite`s at different levels of detail based on the current `MapView` zoom level (replacing distance-based LOD if not relevant for a 2D editor).
        -   This might involve `GameSprite`s having pre-defined simpler versions, or `Item::draw()` choosing not to render certain details (or the whole item) if zoom is too far out.
        -   If `wx`'s `lod_manager.h` defined specific LOD types or thresholds, map these to zoom level ranges.
        -   Specialized items (e.g., those from a "collection brush," or items indicating shadows) should respect LOD settings, possibly using `ItemType`/`TileProperty` attributes to determine their LOD behavior rather than brush-specific overrides.
    - **Lighting Effects:**
        -   If the original editor had a "Shade" visualization or other lighting effects (e.g., darkening lower floors, item-emitted light sources affecting nearby tiles):
            -   Implement these using `QPainter` composition modes, `QGraphicsEffect`, or by modifying sprite colors dynamically during `Item::draw()` or `MapTileItem::paint()`.
            -   `SpriteLight` data (from Task 27, on `GameSprite` or `Item`) should be used if it defines light properties.
            -   Configurable thresholds (e.g., from `DrawingOptions`) should control intensity/visibility.
    - **Transparency Handling (Comprehensive):**
        -   **Sprite Alpha:** Ensure correct rendering of `GameSprite`s that have inherent alpha channels or use color keying.
        -   **Zoom-based Transparency:** Implement transparency effects that vary with zoom level for certain `TileItem`s or other elements, if this was a feature for decluttering the view (e.g., making roofs or tall items more transparent when zoomed out). This logic would be in `MapTileItem::paint()` or individual `Item::draw()`.
        -   **"Show All Floors" Transparency:** If this `DrawingOptions` setting made inactive floors visible but semi-transparent, implement this by adjusting the opacity of `MapTileItem`s on those floors during `MapView` rendering. This should use `Tile` data directly, not sprite sheets that pre-handle visibility unless that was an optimization.
    - **Integration with `DrawingOptions` & Item Properties:**
        -   All these effects should be configurable via `DrawingOptions` or `MapView` settings (Task 75).
        -   `ItemType` properties or specific `Item` attributes might also influence their LOD or lighting/transparency behavior.
    - **OpenGL Tile Bounds (`MapTileItem`):** If original used OpenGL for specific effects like drawing tile bounds with varying transparency, port this visual effect to `QPainter` in `MapTileItem::paint()` if it's not a simple bounding box for debug.
    - **Rendering Structure:** Ensure that any logic for drawing tile or item based attributes for these effects uses existing structures in `project_qt` rather than creating separate lists of objects with specific properties (e.g., `HouseExits` which `TilesetHouse` kept internally for editing).
    - **`Task83.md` is essential: it must detail the exact visual effects for LOD (what changed at what zoom/distance), lighting (how shades were applied, what items emitted light), and transparency (which elements, how configurable), and any specific settings or data (`lod_manager.h`, `DrawingOptions` from `wx`) that controlled these behaviors.**
