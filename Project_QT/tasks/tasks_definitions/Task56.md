**Task56: Implement Remaining Specialized Brushes (House, HouseExit, Waypoint)**
- Task: Migrate the remaining specialized brushes (HouseBrush, HouseExitBrush, WaypointBrush) to Qt, ensuring compatibility with the new `Map`, `Tile`, and `Item` structures, as well as the revised rendering system using `QGraphicsView`. If any of these brushes rely on dialogs or interact with complex tile properties beyond standard drawing/erasing (like house exits changing `Tile` state, waypoint placement potentially updating paths or requiring Tile-specific flags or waypoint-related status updates on the Map/Tile) add placeholder functions to MainWindow to ensure these states get maintained properly and these don't create objects that have no display element or properties in qt versions if those features require Item/brush placement functions rather than directly working on Map or some dedicated Tile property using its attributes rather than item lists now with most special types in wxWidgets which should also reflect in drawing logic as no longer brushes but the specific tiles (when those flags on Tile like `isHouseTile` get read by QGraphicsItem for visualization in Map) or items manage that. Pay close attention to interactions between House brush logic with tile modification or when adding/deleting/moving houses on `Houses` instance by index for which now the internal vector or selection used before should have appropriate setPosition/tile count methods from MapView like `OnHouseIndexSelect` and when actually updating visual elements after modification if tile itself requires something similar using existing qt mechanisms. Also properly implement selection/unselection (`startselectHouse`, etc.) methods using Map Selection data and other controls now if any drawing related functions need a dedicated brush for `House`/`HouseExit` selection. For House exit consider its interactions with Item class - should items be converted when an exit is changed on a `tile->hasHouseExit`.
