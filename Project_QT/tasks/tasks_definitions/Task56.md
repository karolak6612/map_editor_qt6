**Task56: Implement Remaining Specialized Brushes (House, HouseExit, Waypoint - Full Logic & Map Interaction)**
- Task: **Migrate the remaining specialized brushes (`HouseBrush`, `HouseExitBrush`, `WaypointBrush`) to Qt, ensuring full compatibility with the new `Map`, `Tile`, and `Item` structures, the attribute system, and the `QGraphicsView`-based rendering system. This involves implementing their unique behaviors beyond standard drawing/erasing.**
    - **Analyze Existing Brush Stubs:** Build upon any stub classes for these brushes in `Project_QT/src` (e.g., from Task 53's initial brush sweep).
    - **For each brush type:**
        -   **`HouseBrush`:**
            -   `draw()`: Must interact with `Map` data to assign a `HouseID` to tiles, potentially place special house marker `Item`s, or define house boundaries.
            -   Logic related to adding/deleting/moving houses in the `Map`'s list of `House` objects (if `Map` now directly manages `House` instances by index) and how `MapView` interactions (e.g., `OnHouseIndexSelect`) update visual elements.
            -   Implement selection/deselection (`startSelectHouse` etc.) methods using `MapSelection` and relevant UI controls (if this brush has its own selection mode).
        -   **`HouseExitBrush`:**
            -   `draw()`: Must modify a `Tile`'s state to designate it as a house exit. This could involve setting a specific `Tile` flag, adding a special "House Exit" `Item` with attributes defining its destination, or updating a `House` object's exit list.
            -   Ensure this interacts correctly with the `Item` class if an exit involves converting an existing item or changing its properties (e.g., a door becoming an exit).
        -   **`WaypointBrush`:**
            -   `draw()`: Must create a `Waypoint` object (from Task 20/63) and add it to the `Map` or associate it with a specific `Tile`. It may place a visible waypoint marker `Item` on the tile.
            -   `canDraw()` might check if a waypoint can be placed at the target location.
    - **Dialog Interactions (Placeholders or Full):** If these brushes relied on dialogs for configuration (e.g., selecting house attributes, waypoint properties), call these dialogs (stubs from earlier tasks, or fully implemented ones if ready from tasks like Task 71/86).
    - **Complex Tile Property Manipulation:** These brushes often modify complex `Tile` properties or linked `Map` data structures beyond just adding simple visible items. Ensure this logic is ported, using placeholder functions in `MainWindow` or `Map` to maintain state if full systems aren't ready (e.g., if full House editor isn't done, the brush must still conceptually update house state on the map).
    - **Qt Version Compatibility:** Ensure these brushes do not create objects or states that have no display element or property representation in the Qt version if they rely on specific `Item`/brush placement functions rather than directly operating on `Map` data or dedicated `Tile` attributes.
    - **Item-Based Properties:** With many special states now moving to `Item` attributes, these brushes will often work by placing or modifying `Item`s that carry the house/exit/waypoint semantics via their attributes.
    - **`Task56.md` (or individual .md files for each brush) must fully detail the original logic of each brush: how they interacted with map/tile/house/waypoint data, any dialogs they invoked, specific `Tile` flags they set, and how items were created or modified to represent these special map features.**
