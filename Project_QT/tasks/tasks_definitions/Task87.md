**Task87: Complete Creature and Spawn Integration (Sprites, Attributes)**
- Task: Finalize Creature and Spawn system features including visualization with sprites at correct scales based on client data if implemented for certain creatures from what Item now does rather than directly reading image files each tile->draw unless there was additional sprite lookup optimizations with ItemProperties etc where that got separated for performance, handling outfit looktype assignment and visualization (Creature or some Item related to creature will use set\*Type similar to Podium or how any new Brushes do). Creature brushes now need similar properties if not maintaining multiple variants of Creatures in memory from all lookTypes as likely g_creatures's `findCreature` used similar selection methods in creature palettes if Brush manages item-sprite information now to display creature on Tile; handle any drawing functions where it was Creature->sprite and item.h look type methods in editor to check tile-creatures like in Spawn brushes creation via event that gets item or index similar to houses now for specific parameters or create empty implementation with events from tools/palette or view, menus unless there's more efficient Tile based update similar to wall-border drawing functions that set relevant tile properties after Item add using some existing item flags/methods (`isCreatureTile`-like from ItemTypes or flags set from the brush using it on that tiles creature count as before to handle both spawn counts and creature type count when checking selection. Actual adding now is done via actions as item selection does no longer immediate tiles create). Properly implement update method if there were those in Creatures code when they received their sprites and related methods; now using direct lookType on Creature unless its better managed by new GameSprite struct rather than TileItems (e.g. when the original look type was saved at map.loadTile or a new instance-data created there on each tile/spawn create). Adjust map or canvas draw functionality accordingly using updated state data to keep visibility, property handling when theres different levels to support (spawn radius drawing was using tiles unless Spawn or items/brushes can specify what needs visualization by map or type checks there).
