**Task87: Complete `Creature` and `Spawn` Integration (Full Sprites, Attributes, Brushes, UI, Map Drawing)**
- Task: **Finalize all features of the `Creature` and `Spawn` systems. This includes correct sprite visualization for creatures (with outfits/looktypes), full attribute handling, functional `CreatureBrush` and `SpawnBrush` for placing/editing on the map, UI for selecting and configuring creatures/spawns, and proper drawing of spawn markers/areas on the map display.**
    - **Analyze Existing Creature/Spawn Systems:** Build upon `Creature`/`Spawn` data classes (Task 15/19), `CreatureManager` (Task 16), and `GameSprite` (Task 27) in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Creature Sprite Visualization:**
        -   Ensure `Creature` objects (or `Item`s representing creatures) are rendered in `MapView` using their correct `GameSprite`s, at the correct scale.
        -   Fully implement `outfit`/`lookType` assignment and visualization. If a `Creature` object (or an `Item` with creature attributes) has its `lookType` changed (e.g., via a podium `Item` or editor), its `GameSprite` must update to reflect the new appearance (body, head, addons). This relies on `SpriteManager` providing the correct sprite data for each `lookType`.
    - **`CreatureBrush` & `SpawnBrush` Full Functionality:**
        -   **`CreatureBrush`:** When placing a creature: allow selection of creature type (from `CreatureManager`), set its initial attributes (name, health if editable), and place a `Creature` object (or creature `Item`) on the `Tile` in the `Map`.
        -   **`SpawnBrush`:** When placing/editing a spawn: allow configuration of all `Spawn` attributes (creature types, radius, interval, count) via its `QDialog` (Task 19, now fully functional). The brush applies this `Spawn` data to the `Map` at the target location.
    - **UI for Creature/Spawn Selection:**
        -   Implement UI elements in palettes (e.g., a "Creatures" tab in `MainPalette`) to list available creature types from `CreatureManager`. Selecting a creature type here configures `CreatureBrush`.
        -   Ensure the `Spawn` editing dialog is fully functional for modifying all spawn attributes.
    - **Map Drawing for Spawns:**
        -   Visually represent `Spawn` areas on `MapView` (e.g., using `SpawnItem` `QGraphicsItem` from Task 58). This should include drawing the spawn radius and potentially markers for individual creature positions within the spawn if the original did so.
        -   Spawn visualization should update if spawn attributes (like radius) change.
    - **Attribute Handling:** Ensure all `Creature` and `Spawn` attributes are correctly loaded, saved (if part of map data like OTBM or separate spawn XML), and editable.
    - **Interaction with `Tile`:** Update how `Tile`s manage creature presence (e.g., `Tile::addCreature()`, `Tile::getCreatures()`, or if creatures are `Item`s, using the `Tile::items` vector). If original `Tile`s had `isCreatureTile` flags or tracked creature counts directly for selection or spawn density checks, port this logic. All actual adding of creatures/spawns should now be via editor Actions for undo/redo.
    - **Original `Creatures` Code Integration:** If original `Creatures` code had `update()` methods called when sprites were assigned, ensure equivalent logic exists for updating `GameSprite` references or looktype data in `project_qt`.
    - **`Task87.md` must specify the full details of creature outfit/looktype assignment, how `CreatureBrush` and `SpawnBrush` interacted with `MapView` and palettes, the visual representation of spawns (radius, markers), how spawn/creature counts were handled on tiles, and the data persistence format for spawns (OTBM subnode vs. separate file).**
