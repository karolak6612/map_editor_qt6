**Task48: Finish remaining `ItemAttributes`/`Items` (Full OTBM Complex Data Read & Custom Serialization)**
- Task: **Implement any pending features or complete data handling in `Item`s and their attribute system, ensuring they work correctly and comprehensively, especially for reading complex data types from OTBM (OpenTibia Binary Map) format and handling item text. This prepares items for use in property panels and ensures all original item data can be represented.**
    - **Analyze Existing `Item` and Attribute Logic:** Build upon the `Item` class (Task 13) and its attribute map (`QMap<QString, QVariant>`) in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Complex Data from OTBM:** Port all logic from `wxwidgets itemAttributes.cpp` (or related files) responsible for reading complex or custom data structures for `Item` types directly from the OTBM stream if specific attributes were not simple primitives. This includes:
        -   Correctly implementing or adapting functions like `readDataString` if used for handling attributes or specific serialized formats within item attribute blocks.
        -   Handling nested data, lists, or custom binary chunks stored as item attributes.
    - **Item Text Attributes:** Ensure that any attributes representing editable text (e.g., text on signs, book content, descriptions not covered by `Item::getDescription()`) are correctly read from OTBM (or other item definition sources like XML) and stored in the `Item`'s attribute map, preserving encoding (e.g., UTF-8 via `QString`).
    - **Custom Serialization Formats:** If `wxwidgets` items used custom serialization formats for certain attributes (beyond simple key-value pairs in OTBM attribute maps), this logic must be ported using Qt's I/O structures (`QDataStream` with appropriate byte order handling if it was binary) or equivalent text parsing. Ensure these custom formats can be correctly read into and written from the `Item`'s attribute map.
    - **Interface with `itemPropertyEditor`:** Ensure the data loaded here (especially item text and complex attributes) is stored in a way that the `itemPropertyEditor` (Task 45, to be fully implemented later) can access and display it for editing.
    - **`ITEM_ATTR_*` Constants:** Port any `ITEM_ATTR_*` enum or constants from `wxwidgets` that defined keys for specific attributes and ensure they are used consistently for attribute map access in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Goal:** At the end of this task, the `Item` class, through its attribute system, should be capable of loading and storing *all* data associated with an item from its definition files or OTBM, including complex and textual attributes, matching the fidelity of the original `wxwidgets` implementation.
    - **`Task48.md` must provide the specifics of any custom serialization formats used for item attributes, the complete list of `ITEM_ATTR_*` keys, examples of complex data read from OTBM for items, and how text encoding was handled in `wxwidgets`.**
