**Task48: Finish remaining ItemAttributes/Items**
- Implement pending features in items to work correctly, ensure smooth functionality within property panels. Specifically those parts in itemAttributes.cpp for reading complex data from OTBM Item types, item text using the original ITEM\_ATTR and related readDataString implementations if needed for handling attribute maps and custom serialization formats using existing file I/O structures where available in Qt projects using Qt type serializers or similar if they do any transformation at this level - QDataStream's read functions already seem suitable if its a straight format, ensuring those will preserve encoding and any text-string read logic in `itemPropertyEditor`.
