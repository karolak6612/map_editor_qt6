**Task66: Migrate House and Town Handling (Including XML)**
-   Task: Migrate House and Town data structures (`house.h`/`.cpp`, `town.h`/`.cpp`) using appropriate Qt data structures, ensuring proper interaction with `Map` for tile linking using QGraphicsScene mechanisms from Qt version and updating associated Tile and map markers (`setHouse`/`removeHouseExit` via events) if there should be visual or internal changes on tile modification rather than storing as map display layer as with wx versions. Also migrate house-related drawing methods (house brush selection, which uses new Brush and its internal properties like items and not necessarily a dedicated "house" item ID or tile-based selection) using signals and the Item property system (like earlier examples, Item itself might determine by some dedicated function now which types its associated with, as its data attributes or any brush-related id might indicate both its type and whether its visible from what Tiles/in what palette based on which Tile it is - no separate properties menu will exist for example if tile can use Item properties to indicate what brushes it supports at this Item) for `HouseBrush` and others if a dedicated Brush implementation existed when selection changed at those layers, rather than maintaining explicit members on `map_display` itself or `palette`/GUI via mouse which could get convoluted when selecting a type/placing from a Tile which contains the selected or other items associated like tile now managing multiple creature entries if needed as tiles no longer refer via special IDs when something on that Tile position needs info as to which tileset/item should be placed. If there are still cases of updating `wxItems`/selection borders without modifying any of `map::tiles`, properly implement them on map if that logic got decoupled now. Integrate related house xml serialization, adapting house id saving/loading, keeping compatibility where possible when updating existing data, using or merging existing house editing classes into QTile, if the current intention seems these should be direct tiles to allow marking them at a tile/block range on minimap even for a TileLocation if some information (`TileData`, zone) like house exit now exist on Tiles themselves but are shown if not editing (house list only) but other maps items don't affect selection of its related `Tile/item`s via attributes similar to other Brush/item property based drawing logic. If House specific menu commands exist (`showEditHouses`, `select_house`) migrate by implementing appropriately as menu entry/actions as done previously unless they imply some internal display state change that `mapWindow` should now manage like item highlight state after editing those properties or clearing selection which might clear these specific flags like selected. Implement any methods of House editing as tile property actions/replace rather than modifying a Tile with multiple Items for each new House property for faster change management via undo on all items/tiles/house tiles/bounds rather than an editor function setting ids.
