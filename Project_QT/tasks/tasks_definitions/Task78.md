**Task78: Migrate Remaining Dialogs and Windows (Advanced Features)**
-  Task: Migrate complex dialogs and windows from wxWidgets to Qt, preserving their full functionality and interactions with the map editor's core components. Examples: `TilesetWindow` (if that manages what items to move/add from where or does only brush placement in the selection range of positions/Tiles/items for a category on tiles, adapting if its a part of Materials or Brushes instance rather than Palettes - ideally if Brush/ItemType store all data for which these types are used similar to how Tilesets might reference Brushes now using `addToTileset`), similarly handle AboutWindow/HelpSystem if implemented there or elsewhere. Migrate PreferencesWindow (including controls like last used tilesets or window placement settings using appropriate methods if implemented for session state or to reset Brush)  using its functions. Maintain events/data as much as new structures will allow using properties on dialogs and events where there would normally callbacks via wx events to allow interaction between Property panels similar to OnXXXButtonClicked actions/events on wx property dialog or MainMenuBar itself that updated the corresponding palette after `savePreset`/add in other collections windows, including their proper cleanup if these dynamically add Items/Widgets, those like palette which store tiles using map canvas coordinates when displayed using now sceneRect relative position rather than having item store itself if Brush placement uses those directly if items in different containers as Brush handles position using the canvas view coordinates from MapWindow events when tiles are set there and the item selection from brush category has their own palette selection update if those are based on which type those brushes should affect or which types a certain palette page lists on load rather than checking ItemType using wx widgets style properties/flags where these should have gotten decoupled from if the category or Tile on creation stores all needed parameters like walls repel flags. Add dialog closing signal propagation as they typically close or exit view. If MainWindow acts as the receiver when dialog closes like for Preferences, then have those specific event rather than only ID_OK like replaceitems did on save. Check if Tilesets window exists as an `editor-`function. `showResultPanel`/similar handlers were from minimapWindow using what SearchResult window currently has; handle similar data updates via proper calls for items/actions when applicable based on what exactly tiles/layers etc. do if that's their role now rather than an extra panel which likely duplicates those or does not exist separately from tile view similar to house\_names, even for current tileset using only item/brush properties if not needing dedicated classes like Houses for `HouseMap`/item placement as tiles/items no longer need this explicit house attribute from how `map->houses.XXX` were used now.  If there's now both attribute lookup and internal properties, use Qt property/attribute interface mechanisms on `tile`/`Item` class (getter/setter) for flags (like hasItemFlags on Map rather than flags stored only internally) where those imply actual status checks in drawing operations for MapView as much as compatibility would allow.
Focus on the complete GUI migration of dialog windows using appropriate layouts and Qt widget types (`QComboBox`, etc), recreating those widgets as required and hooking to a command system similar to MapWindow for triggering changes at lower levels via signals that carry appropriate states such as which index the choice made, etc or similarly connect dialog buttons actions or dialog callbacks. Ensure if any other elements require explicit calls for `TileItem`/similar update when any of item types, flags or display state for `map`/`baseMap` changes (e.g. how spawn markers are generated, `isXType`).
