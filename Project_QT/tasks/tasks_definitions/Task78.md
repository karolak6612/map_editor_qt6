**Task78: Migrate Remaining Dialogs and Windows (Advanced Features - e.g., `TilesetWindow`, `PreferencesWindow`, `HelpSystem`)**
- Task: **Migrate all remaining complex dialogs and windows from `wxwidgets` to Qt, preserving their full functionality and interactions with the map editor's core components. This includes dialogs for advanced settings, specialized data management, or informational displays not covered by earlier "basic dialog" tasks.**
    - **Analyze Existing Complex Dialogs (`Project_QT/src`):** Review any stubs or partially implemented advanced dialogs.
    - **Identify Target Dialogs (from `Task78.md`):**
        -   `TilesetWindow`: If this was an advanced editor for managing `Tileset` definitions themselves (e.g., creating new tileset categories, assigning items from `ItemManager` to them, moving items between tilesets, defining properties for a tileset), not just a display palette. Its functionality would interact deeply with `TilesetManager` (Task 67).
        -   `PreferencesWindow`: (Building on Task 18 or other settings UI stubs) This must now provide UI controls for *all* application settings managed by `SettingsManager` (Task 97). This includes display options, brush defaults, path settings, automagic settings, etc. Changes must be saved by `SettingsManager`.
        -   `AboutWindow`: A simple dialog displaying application name, version, credits.
        -   `HelpSystem`: If the original had a help window or system (e.g., displaying keybinds, tutorials, or tool explanations), migrate its UI and content loading.
        -   Any other complex dialogs detailed in `Task78.md`.
    - **UI Migration:** For each dialog/window:
        -   Recreate its UI using appropriate Qt widgets (`QTabWidget`, `QTreeView`, `QTableView`, `QTextBrowser`, custom widgets) and layouts. Use Qt Designer (`.ui` files) where practical.
    - **Functionality & Backend Integration:**
        -   Port all business logic from the original `wxDialog` class to its new Qt counterpart.
        -   Connect UI element signals (button clicks, value changes, selection changes) to slots that implement the dialog's functionality, interacting with relevant core editor components (`Map`, `ItemManager`, `SettingsManager`, `TilesetManager`, etc.).
        -   Ensure data displayed in the dialog is correctly loaded from and saved back to the application's data models or settings.
    - **Event/Data Flow:** Maintain event/data flow. If these dialogs initiated actions that modified map data or application state, ensure they now do so via the proper command system (for undo/redo) or by calling methods on core manager classes which then emit signals for UI updates.
    - **Closing Signals & `MainWindow` Interaction:** Ensure dialog closing (`accepted()`, `rejected()`, or custom close events) propagates correctly. If `MainWindow` needs to react to a dialog closing (e.g., `PreferencesWindow` closing might trigger a `MapView` refresh if display settings changed), implement the necessary signal/slot connections or callbacks. This is more specific than a generic `ID_OK` for `ReplaceItemsDialog`'s save.
    - **`TilesetsWindow` context:** Clarify if it's an `editor-function` for defining tilesets vs. a palette. Its interactions are crucial.
    - **`showResultPanel`:** If `showResultPanel` was linked to `MinimapWindow` displaying `SearchResultWindow` content, ensure search results (e.g., from Task 68/82) can be displayed in a similar manner or that equivalent data updates occur.
    - **`Tile`/`Item` Attribute Access:** Ensure these dialogs correctly use the Qt property/attribute interface (`getter/setter` methods on `Tile`/`Item` or direct attribute map access) for any flags or data they display/modify, especially if these imply status checks for rendering (`MapView`).
    - **`Task78.md` must list every "advanced" dialog/window from `wxwidgets`, its purpose, detailed UI layout, how it interacted with other editor components, any specific data it managed, and how its actions were triggered and processed.**
