**Task58: Implement Custom `QGraphicsItems` (Selection, Waypoint, Spawn, Item/Creature on MapTileItem)**
-   Task: Implement `QGraphicsItems` specialized for map selection (with a rubberband display in selection mode similar to MapCanvas in `wxWidgets`), waypoint display (small marker, using standard QGraphicsItem scaling in Qt projects), and spawn visualizations. Adjust how Map or Selection now handles updates for these with QGraphicsScene as these QGraphicsItems get removed if outside the scene as its repositioned, re-created or their states update similar to `MapTileItems` if those can maintain for example spawn marker visual as there's always tiles at those positions and a selection area usually covers many; ensure mapView class if there's a corresponding Selection mode/tool (that should handle SelectionBrush or its implementation) from View modes sets state on its MapItems for tile selected states similar to `wxMapCanvas`. For special map types which might only draw indicators (on map when applicable like Item->`has*ID`/flags from TileMap) similar to zoneIds on Wx map and Tiles or items from special collections rather than having dedicated placeholders - determine a appropriate strategy using scene/item attributes to know for example where to render a rectangle of specific color/type at item position (like house borders in EXT_HOUSE_SHADER mode), rather than Brush having its specific render functions using the new 2D system like QGraphicsEffect or painter on those tiles when needed if thats an easier implementation and if its better using generic QGraphicsItems using a color from properties or Tile/Item rather than the palette/custom-sized brushes (which is better suited with a `GameSprite` than simple overlay with `wx/draw.cpp`).
