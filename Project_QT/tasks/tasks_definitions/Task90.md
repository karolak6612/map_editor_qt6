**Task90: Add Minimap functionality:**
Recreate Minimap with functions like `UpdateView/OnClick` for now or implement to display similar Tile-view from canvas/MapView as minimap to ensure all Tile rendering for color information as visible via draw has also now working code in map using appropriate events to notify.  These interactions (like centering based on position clicked with tiles in minimap which should allow going to position or similar functionality) should now update via signals on MapCanvas rather than as properties. Implement zoom buttons if implemented on map. Update existing functions (g_gui-`RefreshMinimap`, or MinimapWindow itself calling MapPanel refresh if that managed the selection boxes, using Tile bounds rather than pixel for a general boundingBox visualization via OpenGL which likely requires setting position using similar code if not managing tile highlight state there too similar to `tile->select()`) for use with current QGraphicsItems similar to `map_display`/ `Tiles` `MapView`/tile items interaction and any events on MapView like scroll or similar interaction if tile drawing, or MinimapView needs them, including any updates (when mouse hovers over map items similar to Brush Preview cursor or for `DrawingOptions`/Tiles having their property status like selection border rather than doing it on all mouse clicks unless click does highlight a single tile with marker or updates internal map\_display like wx did at select operation if map canvas or `MapView` using QGraphicsView needs special items, attributes there now to track and render based on current Tile data when rendering via a single QGraphicsView).
