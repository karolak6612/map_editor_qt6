**Task13: Migrate Item class properties & structure.**
- Implement the `Item` class in `project_qt`. Correctly transfer properties using `ItemManager::ItemProperties` when loading via `createItem`. `m_properties` should now refer to those in `ItemManager`, ensuring consistent property access throughout `Item`. Handle boolean and non-boolean properties for visualization if these need dedicated member flags or similar efficient-check states in addition to attribute maps in Item class. Maintain all `ItemPropertyFlag` derived information directly via methods. Keep basic rendering for placeholders; full rendering via sprites later. Maintain access and setting via String-like keys for generic `setAttribute()` or direct int getters and bool getters if needed based on intended ItemProperty handling. Item attributes should ideally store all information (e.g. ID, isXXX states, Count, text), while also ensuring flags related to `ItemPropertyFlag` remain or get their states appropriately via ItemManager if those determine things like display ordering, collision check etc. Store the existing name using new TypeInfo struct in `Item` with optional type field string in attributes map to make ItemType easily queryable, or use the string itself from ItemType if Item subclasses don't materialize. Migrate ALL attribute saving and retrieval methods using QVariant and QMap mechanisms. Update/migrate only the struct/data definitions and essential properties, type, access, conversion between `Item::Type` strings to actual classes will come later. Migrate `draw` for text display using painter. Keep track of "hasAttribute", even for implicit defaults in Qt versions (count = 1 if stackable etc). `getDescription` logic using `ItemPropertyFlag` or dedicated description attr for properties, etc.
