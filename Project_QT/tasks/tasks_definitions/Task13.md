**Task13: Migrate `Item` class properties & structure (Full Attribute Model, Type Handling, Basic Rendering)**
- Task: **Implement the `Item` class in `project_qt`, ensuring a comprehensive migration of its properties, attribute handling, and core structural elements from the `wxwidgets` version.**
    - **Analyze Existing Code:** Thoroughly review and integrate with, refactor, or replace any existing `Item` class implementation in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Property and Attribute Management:**
        -   When an `Item` is conceptually "loaded" or "created" (e.g., by `ItemManager` after Task 14/24), ensure its properties (originating from `ItemManager::ItemProperties` or DAT/OTB files) are correctly transferred and accessible.
        -   The `Item` class should primarily manage its attributes using a flexible system, likely `QMap<QString, QVariant>` for generic attributes, complemented by direct member variables for performance-critical flags (e.g., booleans like `isMoveable`, `isBlocking`) or frequently accessed data, as detailed in `Task13.md`.
        -   Implement robust `setAttribute(const QString& key, const QVariant& value)` and `QVariant getAttribute(const QString& key, const QVariant& defaultValue = QVariant()) const` methods. Also implement direct int/bool getters (e.g., `getID()`, `isStackable()`) if these provide significant performance benefits or map directly to `ItemPropertyFlag` concepts.
        -   All `ItemPropertyFlag` derived information (from `wxwidgets`) must be accessible either directly via methods on `Item` or through attribute lookups.
    - **Type Information:**
        -   Store the `Item`'s specific type information. This could be via a `TypeInfo` struct member (if used in `wxwidgets`), a string representing its type name stored in the attributes map, or an internal `ItemTypeID`. This information should be easily queryable. The goal is to allow `ItemManager` or other systems to determine the specific nature of an `Item`.
    - **Rendering (Placeholder & Basic Text):**
        -   Keep basic rendering placeholders if full sprite rendering (Task 54) is not yet integrated.
        -   Migrate the original `Item::draw` logic for text display (e.g., displaying item counts, specific text attributes) using a passed `QPainter` and the item's attributes, matching `wxwidgets` output.
    - **Attribute Persistence & Retrieval:**
        -   Migrate ALL attribute saving and retrieval methods using mechanisms suitable for `QVariant` and `QMap` or specific binary formats if attributes were part of OTBM/DAT item serialization in `wxwidgets`.
        -   Ensure methods like `hasAttribute(const QString& key)` are implemented, correctly handling implicit defaults (e.g., `count` should be 1 if an item is stackable and no count is specified if the original logic dictated this).
    - **Description Logic:** Implement `getDescription()`, which should construct the item's description string based on its attributes, `ItemPropertyFlag` information, or a dedicated description attribute, precisely mirroring the `wxwidgets` behavior.
    - **Scope:** This task focuses on the `Item` class's data structure, attribute system, and basic property access. Full integration with the `ItemManager`'s type system (Task 24) and `GameSprite` rendering (Task 54) are subsequent steps that will build upon this foundation.
    - **`Task13.md` is the authoritative source for the full list of `ItemPropertyFlag`s, attribute keys, structure of `TypeInfo` (if applicable), the exact behavior of `getDescription` and other core `Item` methods from `wxwidgets`, and how boolean vs. non-boolean properties should be handled for visualization/checks.**
