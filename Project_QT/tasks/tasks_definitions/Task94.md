**Task94: Implement and Integrate the `Houses` and `Towns` System**
- Task: Fully integrate the Houses and Towns system into the Qt project, ensuring proper data management, UI interaction, and synchronization with the map and minimap. Migrate related dialogs (EditHouse, EditTowns), creating new dialogs or integrating their functionality into existing Qt panels/widgets if applicable, and connect them with the main application logic and events like `Tile` selection. Adapt or create dedicated property display/editor panels (`HousePropertiesPanel`, similar for towns, and ensure waypoint editors that were there now properly create or replace them if there's similar brush types now from what Item manager uses via palettes and selection rather than explicit map manipulation by tile position unless having the brush or related tool/`action::XXXHouses`  handle those and those signal changed Tile). Maintain data synchronization with the main map if applicable when items or tile data using for example houses might get loaded at initialization stages (similar to creature sprites and attributes, tile ground properties from items after spr loaded, any default wall settings when walls_repell etc. gets set like when replacing map using a TemplateMap when converting version for items; these set using either direct id, ItemTypeProperties at this phase based on whether these brushes from a specific `PalettePanel`/category like Item or collection etc) from .OTBM or similar rather than house, tiles data directly holding flags or their ItemProperty attributes, using now what Tile has in the XML saving (`houseExits`, `hasStairs`/etc or implement from other Item properties like how isBorder had explicit checks before unless Tile still requires these to signal) using dedicated `g_materials::Houses/HouseTileset` collection to replace HouseTile on load with explicit setter for that type on Tiles from map's load, mirroring similar functions. Adjust existing editor events where these properties changed (`HouseDoorId` gets moved as part of items) including after drawing to properly link data via commands/new Tile-related actions or their own ItemAttribute sets similar to door states (if not maintaining HouseExit as property), for visualization now via standard marker if these indicate where towns, etc should appear via Brush or dedicated items placed using existing tile add methods rather than `houses` map now on any Tiles in qt-versions that likely need additional helpers in QTile, and whether minimap/its layers also contain tiles matching certain property now directly on tiles. Also keep undoable state via existing Action system when any property editor commits change to maintain compatibility (those from find similar, border/wall system already trigger those).
