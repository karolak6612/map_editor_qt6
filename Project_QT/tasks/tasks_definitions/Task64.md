**Task64: Move all Item Properties Loading from `Items` into `SpriteManager` (from `.dat`, or derive a combined `Items` manager if it also holds `ItemType`/game information to ensure sprite IDs etc. remain consistent.)**
Ensure smooth flow of property data loading between both if there is now shared data or access of `items->items` list. Note the different client version formats in SpriteManager's load functions and Items `items->getItemFlags`, ensuring they stay in sync even after type refactors as these methods now might access directly. Also correctly preserve special item definitions using an appropriate ID rather than just the ItemType from what is available via current .otb since that determines drawing behaviour and visibility even before map or its Items (that are now Tile items too, no longer need for the extra item layer/category or explicit selection at this time as any Items are added by type by new Brush/tool panel events if theres no appropriate properties panel yet or items selection and similar mechanisms will determine current item for brush; the actual Tile data should no longer have these items on it which Map holds during selection or any functions that look across all items with the Tile position, only in the special collections using hasX to ensure there's now explicit removal/clearing via addTile/`removeTileItem` on selection. Similarly Item removal using map `EraseItem`/other clearXXX methods seem a secondary operation after removing those on Tiles in those cases too. `Brush`/Tile/map no longer modify anything immediately in qt map) has created that rather ItemManager needs those items present for Brushes or specific drawing behavior when editing map - like how houses/towns have theirs associated IDs and their specific items must exist with house ids and exits rather than tile or Items defining how these properties determine what should be added based on those properties. `g_tilesets`, `g_items` will also get refactored as more unified/single class with Brush logic split into different palette pages (e.g. for `Terrain`) handling if Items belong into that tileset (`TilesetContainer` using Brush/brush selection), similarly for Waypoints or how special collections using map-level Tile items were loaded from `item-names`. For `creatures.h` add direct ID getters if the intent is for them to replace `ItemProperty` enum access.
