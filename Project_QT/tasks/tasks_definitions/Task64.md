**Task64: Move all Item Properties Loading from `Items` class into `SpriteManager` (or Combined Asset Manager - Unifying `.dat`/Sprite/ItemType Logic)**
- Task: **Refactor the loading of fundamental `Item` properties (especially those tied to sprite appearances, client IDs, and core flags like walkability, stackability, etc., often found in `.dat` files) from the old `wxwidgets Items` class (or equivalent global item database) into `SpriteManager` (Task 35) or, if more appropriate, a new combined `GameAssetLoader` class. The goal is to ensure that sprite ID information, core `ItemType` data, and game version compatibility are managed consistently and loaded from their primary source files (`.dat`, `.spr`) by a single authoritative system.**
    - **Analyze Existing Asset Loading:** Review how `Project_QT/src`'s `SpriteManager` (Task 35) and `ItemManager` (Task 14) currently load data. This task aims to centralize the initial loading of sprite-linked item properties.
    - **Target Data:** Focus on properties from `.dat` files that directly relate item client IDs to their visual sprite IDs, animation info, and core behavioral flags (e.g., ground speed, blocking, moveable, stackable, usable, if these were in `.dat`).
    - **`SpriteManager` Enhancement (or new `GameAssetLoader`):**
        -   The chosen manager (`SpriteManager` or a new one) will now be responsible for parsing the relevant sections of `.dat` files in conjunction with `.spr` files.
        -   It will build an internal data structure that links `ClientID` to `SpriteID(s)`, animation details, and these core `ItemType` properties.
    - **Data Flow to `ItemManager`:**
        -   `ItemManager` will then query this enhanced `SpriteManager` (or `GameAssetLoader`) to get these fundamental properties when loading its more detailed item definitions (e.g., from `.otb` or `items.xml`). `ItemManager` builds upon this base data with richer attributes like descriptions, unique/magic properties, etc.
    - **Client Version Consistency:** This central loader must correctly handle different client version formats for `.dat`/`.spr` files to ensure that sprite IDs and item flags remain consistent and correctly mapped for the loaded game version.
    - **Decoupling:** This should decouple `ItemManager` from needing to parse low-level sprite/DAT formats directly, making `ItemManager` focus on higher-level item attributes and logic.
    - **Refactoring `g_tilesets`, `g_items`:** If global instances like `g_tilesets` or `g_items` from `wxwidgets` were responsible for this joined loading, their logic needs to be moved into this new manager. `TilesetContainer` logic that uses `Brush`/brush selection would then get its base item data from this system. The same applies to how special collections (like map-level `Tile` items if defined in `item-names`) were loaded if tied to sprite/DAT data.
    - **Creature Data (`creatures.h`):** If creature definitions from `.dat` (like `lookType` mapping to sprite IDs) were also handled by the old `Items` class, this logic should also move to `SpriteManager` or the unified loader. Add direct ID getters to `Creature` if it's meant to replace direct `ItemProperty` enum access for creature-specific flags from `.dat`.
    - **`Task64.md` must precisely detail how the `wxwidgets Items` class (or equivalents) loaded and merged data from `.dat`, `.spr`, and possibly other files (like `items.otb`/`items.xml` if there was an overlap in core properties), how it handled different client versions, and what specific data structures it used to store this unified item/sprite information that `SpriteManager` must now replicate.**
