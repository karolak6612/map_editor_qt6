**Task34: Brush interaction structure and helpers**
- Task: Create new classes with structures to handle user interactions through both the main MapCanvas drawing or the right-click Menu which are handled there by onX functions in MapCanvas, triggering events that should propagate correctly based on the selection/drawing mode (like tile-based draw functions in Mouse click which might add a `Tile` item or trigger the `Tile` properties themselves for basic actions. This means basic drawTile operation from click coordinates in Mouse release from the position (mouse-release) needs converting for both drag operations, mouse moves which have state machines (canvas.cpp), as well as generic addTileItem and how that signals both map, selection to properly update after a brush modification as some tile level changes seem to reset or modify some Tile flags which would need an appropriate event or updateTiles(range of X and Y) by any Draw command. Selection mode itself seems special since Selection doesn't push the item change itself but rather editor seems responsible for creating DeleteSelectionCommand with an add for replacing its items which need a bit more work using clipboard and other map view classes, same paste-with behaviour on those from tile copy with similar issues for selection operations when there's no immediate effect with drag being a bit different; however, MouseMove still operates there and will modify both canvas state via `wxWidgets::SelectionBoxUpdate` and when updating MapScene in wxWidgets versions which likely will get moved entirely into QGraphicsView and mouse events. Move actions will be complex and likely get refactored through map editing/item replacement but still happen here if triggered directly, similar for Rotation).  Move methods for actual Tile/Map manipulation will need separate ItemPlacement/Removal command structures like TileBrush and AddItemCommand/NormalBrush usage, ensuring proper conversion/updating, but at first the event and tile click/rect areas itself for brushes with variable sizes as well needs correct updating to `tile->addXXXXItem()` when tile data structures are added like `ground` items (`Terrain`) being set, border added or removed. Focus only on events that cause visual modifications - actual actions later, and mouse/context updates based on active layer will need MapViews input if tile draw/placement respects layer selection at those methods or MouseClicks tile target identification needs Z as in Mouse events for floor. The basic action framework in place was `MouseClick -> ActionType from menu or drawing -> Tiles identified -> Items handled -> Action queued -> Tile/Map modified` where Tiles was identified via a range of operations including relative brush offsets or the full selection rectangle. Update those appropriately as much as possible for selection as that is tricky with multi-tile manipulation and updating those changes in graphics context, similarly brush draw might trigger the main Map changes but ideally only once on an operation unless item property manipulation from palette triggers changes on items of same ID as the one actively edited through another signal/connection system similar to the refresh callbacks in `Wx::Editor`.
