**Task30: Replace `wxStatusBar` to Qt and simplify (Core Fields, `MainWindow` Update Methods)**
- Task: **Replace the existing `wxStatusBar` from `wxwidgets` with Qt's `QStatusBar` in `project_qt`'s `MainWindow`. Consolidate and implement the display of essential status information.**
    - **Analyze Existing `StatusBar`:** Review any current status bar implementation in `Project_QT/src`'s `MainWindow`.
    - **`QStatusBar` Integration:** Add a `QStatusBar` to the `QMainWindow`. This can be done via `QMainWindow::setStatusBar()` or by directly creating it.
    - **Information Fields (Initial Set):** Consolidate the information fields previously displayed. Based on original functionality and `Task30.md`, include core fields such as:
        -   Current mouse map coordinates (X, Y, Z).
        -   Name/ID of the currently selected `Brush` tool.
        -   Basic information about a selected `Item` on the map (e.g., its ID and name).
        -   Current zoom level.
        -   Active layer/floor.
        -   You can use `QLabel` widgets added to the `QStatusBar` (via `addPermanentWidget` or `addWidget`) to manage these distinct fields if complex formatting or updates are needed, or use `QStatusBar::showMessage()` for temporary messages and its sections for more permanent ones.
    - **Update Mechanism in `MainWindow`:** Implement methods in `MainWindow` (or a dedicated status bar controller class) to update the content of these status bar fields. For example:
        -   `void MainWindow::updateMouseMapCoordinates(const QPoint3D& mapPos)`
        -   `void MainWindow::updateCurrentBrush(Brush* brush)`
        -   `void MainWindow::updateSelectedItemInfo(Item* item)`
        -   `void MainWindow::updateZoomLevel(double zoom)`
        -   `void MainWindow::updateCurrentLayer(int layer)`
    - **Initial State & Connections (Placeholder):** On startup, initialize the status bar fields to default values. Actual dynamic updates based on `MapView` mouse movements, brush selection from palettes, item selection on the map, or zoom/layer changes will be connected via signals/slots in later tasks. For now, ensure these `MainWindow` update methods can be called to manually change the status bar display.
    - **Cursor Methods:** Migrate any methods related to updating the mouse cursor's appearance or state if they were previously tied to status bar update logic or originated from similar contexts in `wxwidgets`.
    - **`Task30.md` will specify the exact fields required, their order, if any were "permanent" vs. temporary messages, and any formatting requirements from the original `wxStatusBar`.**
