**Task30:  Replace wxStatusBar to Qt and simplify**
- Replace the current status bar with Qt, consolidate the information fields if reasonable for the current simplified view of status information to simply keep track of: Pos(xyz), Current Brush (for feedback if selected a tool from palette if brush selection from toolPanel implies a signal updating only MapViews and then a global setting is updated which calls back into statusbar via `UpdateStatusBar()` to redisplay selected `Brush`, ideally not via MainWindow properties themselves for brush) or an Item's info (for tool tip/basic properties like before) when user clicks a `MapTileItem` and not if an EditorTab selected that implies some general "tab"/document properties display which might indicate which view-style selected by View menus/toolbars on statusbar or when any special tool from Tools are triggered directly without passing it around for generic tab statuses to statusbar from Map. Handle the update mechanism; status text gets updated whenever anything changes based on `getMap/selection state`, mouse, active brush (like zoom on MapView/MapCanvas calls out a signal directly to statusbar/main windows zoom status method) rather than an explicit 'OnXchanged` on all states which is simpler as it doesn't rely on too much signal-passing across classes/members. Migrate related cursor methods.
