**Task57: Migrate `FlagBrush` (Zones)**
- Migrate `FlagBrush` to maintain zone settings and attributes for tiles like `ZoneID`/mapflags etc (or appropriate representation if theres only ItemProperties via AttributeMap from Item for that). Create and load related menu/tool buttons and commands where FlagBrushes (e.g. PZ brush, no-logout, other flags if its TileMapFlags using static members rather than node property on read like BORDERTYPE as this was based on TileLocation which no longer needs or keeps them but `BaseMap::mapFlags`) were used to manipulate tiles, creating actions from modified tile as those now get handled with any drawing commands via the tile structure if the "Zone flags" themselves are simply Items that have special state using IsZone to identify now in draw or a category or attributes like items->flags that get converted or trigger some visual indicator when needed (for borders) in Tile rather than being stored in some MapView instance variable (Map already does the internal bookkeeping there like its mapflag member).
