**Task100: Refactor, Optimize, Test, and Finalize:**
Thoroughly review, refactor, and optimize the entire `project_qt` codebase for efficient resource handling, consistent architecture, and appropriate usage of Qt's advanced rendering and UI features. Resolve potential namespace conflicts and streamline data flow if similar property/status checks are called across many places to access, using existing QTile data now via Items to maintain type compatibility for new Brushes unless something triggers extra update logic which likely would need similar tile changed signals when for instance any of ItemProperties flags on Tile changes or `HouseId` does now, while also simplifying those methods themselves that don't set properties directly but these should instead use tiles internal data in map after creating/adding an item unless only checking if a certain condition using flags or the actual type present from where tile might generate it based on any existing ones in it (`GroundType`) to avoid multiple steps of placing and adding a specific id and having those functions in addition or calling if already tile had such a `item/property`, if thats more inline with new Brushes and tilesets as those no longer necessarily contain items or tile-specific functions rather they refer to which kind of ItemBrush rather than tile from tilemaps should get what ID when a map is saved unless there are certain features of older tiles that should keep these on the Tile rather than by items or properties, if only a small part/count on tile like some spawns need them. Fix remaining errors, warnings, and exceptions during testing with small tiles/test maps at all key areas before building/running the converted larger ones; update if needed QObject system to create and keep similar global instances rather than via MainWindow members and its signals, ensuring thread-safe memory management using Qt-equivalent data structures (those `QList`, `std::vector/list/queue/deque`, other collection, smart ptr (`std::unique\_ptr` etc if there was a reference in original from something using this class for temporary storage like drawing a brush area but did not actually `delete` on destruct rather MainWindow does it on unload).
