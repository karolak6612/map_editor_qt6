**Task37: Implement `TerrainBrush` (Base for Terrain Types)**
- Create the base class `TerrainBrush` in project_qt, inheriting from the new `Brush` class and transferring basic properties and logic (like name, look\_id, friend/enemy handling via Brush IDs if needed, z-order, if relevant for 3D or just plain drawing order. Implement basic `draw()`/`undraw()` as stubs or basic functionality as much as the pure virtual interface in `Brush` would allow as terrain brushes in wxwidgets didn't appear to modify Item or tile immediately at this call, that seems handled in `mousePressEvent` calls like NormalBrush used which is similar for Flood fill, rather these functions seem to populate map temporarily as secondary\_map which then QGraphicsScene would check for placement/interactions at draw events via mainWindow and `map_display.h`-like interactions in view on clicks rather than brush doing it on its own to keep separation between the rendering/editing loop).
