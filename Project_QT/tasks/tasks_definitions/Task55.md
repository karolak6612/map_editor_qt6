**Task55: Add Support for `Item` Attributes Map (Advanced Properties, Door/Container Logic, `creatureMap` on `Tile`)**
- Task: **Migrate the full `Item` attribute map feature, ensuring comprehensive handling of all advanced item properties and complex use cases, including those triggering broader UI/map updates. This solidifies the `Item` class as the central repository for all item-specific data beyond basic flags.**
    - **Analyze Existing Attribute System:** Enhance the `Item`'s attribute map (`QMap<QString, QVariant>`) and set/getAttribute methods (Task 13/48) in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Migrate Advanced Properties:** Systematically identify and migrate all complex item properties from `wxwidgets` that were managed via specific members, `ItemInfo` structs, or hardcoded logic, into the attribute map system. Examples:
        -   `Door` items: `doorID` (linking to another door), `destinationPosition`.
        -   `Container` items: capacity, content (list of contained item IDs or serialized items), restrictions.
        -   Teleports: destination position/description.
        -   Beds: sleep/regeneration properties.
        -   Items with charges, durations, or break chances.
        -   Any item triggering a UI refresh or requiring interaction with other systems (e.g., opening a container showing a new UI, a podium changing a creature's appearance via `set/getCreature` logic on `Tile`).
    - **Context Menu & Property Editor Integration:** Ensure that when these advanced properties are modified (e.g., via a context menu on a tile with the item, or through property editors/selection property panels from brush palettes), the `Item`'s attributes are updated correctly, and these changes persist (for saving) and trigger necessary view updates (e.g., map view, item property display). This likely involves `Item` emitting a signal when an attribute changes.
    - **`Tile::creatureMap` (or `Tile`'s Creature/Spawn List):** Finalize how `Tile` stores a list of creatures and/or spawns (if `Task11.md` specified `QVector<Creature*>` etc. or if there's a `creatureMap` concept that items on the tile can contribute to). `Item`s that represent creatures or spawns will store their specific data (creature type, spawn details) in their attributes. The `Tile` then aggregates this for rendering or queries.
    - **Unified Attribute Access:** The goal is that most item-specific data, beyond core rendering/physics flags, is accessible via `item->getAttribute("propertyName")`. Specialized methods on `Item` (or its subclasses if using them) can provide typed wrappers around this (e.g., `QPoint DoorItem::getDestination() const { return getAttribute("destination").toPoint(); }`).
    - **Data Types & Serialization:** Use appropriate `QVariant` types for storing diverse attribute data. Ensure these attributes are correctly serialized/deserialized by `Item::serialize/deserialize` methods (Task 51), especially if complex types like position vectors or lists of items need custom handling with `QDataStream` or JSON structures for string attributes (`QByteArray` usage should be reviewed for string data).
    - **No More Special Member States (Ideally):** Transition away from many specialized boolean member flags if these can be represented by the attribute map or by `ItemType` properties, unless critically needed for performance in rendering/collision loops. The map should reflect `ItemType` or general map checks rather than many "any item on this tile has X flag" checks.
    - **`Task55.md` needs to list all "advanced properties" for all significant item types from `wxwidgets` (doors, containers, teleports, beds, etc.), their original data types/structures, how they were accessed/modified, and how they affected UI or game state, to ensure complete migration into the attribute map system.**
