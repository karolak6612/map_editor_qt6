**Task55: Add Support for Attributes Map (Advanced Properties)**
- Migrate full Attribute map feature and handling of all advanced properties or complex cases such as Door->doorID, similar Container related features which might trigger a full refresh (of view rather than item only using existing calls in both the context menu on tiles with a tile and on property editors/selection properties panels in Brush panels as much as the initial state will permit - similar to previous methods) when tiles and other parts like doors used its items, which needed either a separate `ItemInfo` update, similar if selection.h used it like when tiles or other elements have actions that only indirectly trigger Item changes, like House id change or if Spawns had `set/getCreature`. All new Item methods are in line with Attribute Map design using set/getAttribute with various implementations rather than by both special member states for each and via maps or a generic type-access only as before when `ItemData`/ItemProperties had all states/attributes on items which should remain but without all needing a member function as many flags might not affect draw, or map needs `Tiles`/`Items` to know those properties specifically via `hasItem(PROPERTY::x)` call rather than generic "any of the contained in my view or any part of my selection at a floor has property"-like check using itemType as in old selection methods using its internal properties, to ensure item attributes handling for all possible data on tiles or when tiles are being converted are working; use Qt String conversions (`QByteArray`) if storing additional non-string/numerical data for attributes such as position vectors of doors to properly display on house property editor via Qt if possible and is also portable like JSON should. Note: Tile now stores a list of creatures/spawns - `creatureMap`.
