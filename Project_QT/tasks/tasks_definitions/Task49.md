**Task49: Basic `TilePropertyEditor` Migration**
- Start work on `TilePropertyEditor` by moving existing Tile methods for properties (`wxtile.h`, `tile.cpp`), and basic handling to UI via a panel similar to `wxWidgets::TilePropertiesWindow` but do NOT link or actually use for display in map, its meant just as a structural test, testing any `isXXXX` flag/status lookup by using Item properties or dedicated states, etc in project_qt when possible to make later migration more clear where certain attributes now end up after ItemType refactor, keeping in mind a single `ItemPropertyFlag` set might need multiple internal methods and access points on tiles if itemtypes themselves don't store specific state on whether those apply to a single tile as property but these are rather checks for existing items in item list on wxtiles/wx items, including `zoneID`/`houseID` to have their update status if `set()` is called but those also imply any tiles where they belong get updated like in previous update function example after editing using `edit_towns`/house editors via Map signals that propagate changes in houses etc like wx's map implemented, for instance if house tilesets (`map->setHouses`) calls something like UpdateHouseDisplay on all `HouseTiles` items where applicable or similarly updates any associated property like that directly for specific House Brush like setting in palette after drawing for tiles for `house->tileCount` etc and where exactly those tile changes (via HouseId, Tile/brush/flag-items set with house related property) should happen. Implement just the base and core method implementations needed for Property editor functionality. Full item editing features will be addressed when PropertiesDock implementation begins which handles the panel switching/context from mapviews item selection if any items of type X get editing tool by that type, similarly there'll likely a separate interface/editor when no items in `wxItems` can create that complex property as it implies opening an editing panel there as tiles have different attributes but PropertyEditor itself cannot create them like what tiles->`getHouse()` calls attempt or in similar items case of `find*ByProperty`. The new PropertyEditors should directly query attributes (from selection data - if an appropriate EditorTab exists via Mainwindow property if using propertyDock to differentiate tabs types of selected) since creating new Item objects on display is rather the panels function than property editors - no more "browse Tile/select brushes"-like functions should be there but should maintain methods used there from original for getting or loading a single item on map (`getTopSelectedItem`).
