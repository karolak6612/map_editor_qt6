**Task49: Basic `TilePropertyEditor` Migration (UI Structure, Placeholder Property Display)**
- Task: **Start work on the `TilePropertyEditor` by moving existing `Tile` methods for accessing properties (from `wxtile.h`, `tile.cpp`) into a conceptual Qt property system for tiles, and creating the basic UI structure for a panel or dialog to display these properties. This is an initial structural test.**
    - **Analyze Existing `Tile` Properties & UI:** Review `Project_QT/src` for how `Tile` properties are currently exposed and if any UI for tile editing exists.
    - **`Tile` Property Access in Qt:**
        -   Identify all methods in `wxwidgets Tile` that were used to get or set tile-specific properties (e.g., `isPZ()`, `getHouseID()`, `getZoneID()`, flags like `TILESTATE_PROTECTIONZONE`).
        -   Ensure the `Project_QT/src Tile` class (from Task 12) has corresponding getter methods (and placeholder setters if appropriate for later editing). These might query `Item` properties on the tile (e.g., if a "PZ stone" item makes a tile PZ) or dedicated `Tile` member states.
    - **UI Structure (`TilePropertyEditor`):**
        -   Create the basic UI for the `TilePropertyEditor` (this might be a `QWidget` for a dockable panel or a `QDialog`), mirroring the layout of the original `wxWidgets::TilePropertiesWindow` as per `Task49.md`.
        -   Add placeholder UI controls (`QLabel`s, `QLineEdit`s (read-only for now), `QCheckBox`es (disabled for now)) for displaying the key tile properties.
    - **Placeholder Data Display (No Binding Yet):**
        -   Implement a method in `TilePropertyEditor` like `void displayTileProperties(Tile* tile)` which, given a `Tile*`, reads its properties (using the new Qt `Tile` accessors) and populates the placeholder UI controls *textually* (e.g., `labelPZ->setText(tile->isPZ() ? "Yes" : "No")`).
        -   No actual data binding or editing capability is implemented in this task. The focus is on proving the UI structure can be populated from `Tile` data.
    - **Consideration for ItemType Refactor:** Keep in mind how attributes previously on `Tile`s might now reside on `Item`s within that `Tile` after an `ItemType` refactor. The property editor will eventually need to inspect the `Tile`'s item list.
    - **Update Status (Conceptual):** For properties like `zoneID` or `houseID`, if setting them in `wxwidgets` implied that all tiles belonging to that zone/house needed an update (e.g., via `Map` signals like `edit_towns`/house editors caused), note this interaction for later full implementation. For now, setting is out of scope.
    - **`getTopSelectedItem()` for context:** If the original editor had a function like `getTopSelectedItem()` to determine context for the property editor when a tile was selected, this logic should be conceptually mapped to how `Project_QT` identifies the current editing context (e.g., selection in `MapView`).
    - **`Task49.md` must identify all properties displayed by `wxTilePropertiesWindow`, their data types, and how they were read from the `wxTile`. It should also clarify the relationship between `Tile` flags and properties versus `Item` properties residing on the tile.**
