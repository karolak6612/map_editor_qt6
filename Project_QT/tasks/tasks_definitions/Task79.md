**Task79: Implement remaining selection tool features (actions, signals, copy/cut/paste commands)**
*	Fully implement selection.h for mouse actions including item transformation/deletion. Focus now on proper linking to create copy/paste from source's clipboard/actions into a QT map command/action similar to Selection's move functionality, maintaining as required any additional info or checks it kept (via item.h properties that indicate what state its in for later reconstruction and undo/clipboard if applicable and not relying just on Item itself as in newer implementations from tile->`ItemProperties`, e.g. how copy did in selection, using those flags as direct access to its underlying properties now after removing from that map like pop methods where in qt tile class/actions would iterate by type at undo). Include visual updates on paste operations to prevent potential crashes by having any QGraphicsView `refreshItems()`-type events call similar to Wx selection mode tile select/set. Update if item selection from current tile sets states (hasSelected, isSelectedTile) for instance in DrawingOptions to properly display based on tile type selected if these use tile selection, flags, Item types in Qt versions.
