**Task53: Migrate remaining Brush types to Qt (Carpet, Table, Creature, Spawn, etc.)**
- Task: Implement remaining Brush specializations into individual classes (or appropriately derive) ensuring consistency with previous Brush creation and selection logic in BrushManager/MainWindow; for drawing these create dummy placement functions using their own Item or map states in editor. These should include all similar functions/logic that these special types use for brushes now in `brush.cpp/h` along with updating where needed these after the change to how `Tile::items` manage properties rather than being a member like if DoorBrush should also implement wall\_alignment or if `GroundBrush` now creates and initializes a full `AutoBorder` directly via BorderManager rather than relying on a method in Selection for what that calls based on tile positions like done on a tile selection or map resize using selection borders or similar mechanism using map->`tiles[z]` etc when tileset was originally made or any additional update cases like after the addition or deletion of House on Map when that type changes to indicate those need their exit tiles reevaluated (those `add*/remove*/set*HouseExit` calls on tile in those instances using action lists). If their type determines any of Tile's additional attribute based `hasXXXX` implement accordingly, similarly when `Brush` itself doesn't get used during actual draw. The new functions to mirror that `doCarpets`, etc. should exist as either map function like BorderSystem does automatic borders after editing `Ground`/TerrainTiles for tables as well (`recalculateTablesForRect`, similarly `recalculateWalls`, reDoAllCarpets using rect rather than position set as this implied an area to recalculate these by Tile for specific area/selection from last changes done on selection rather than for arbitrary areas when theres no tile modifications, as that appears only to affect the ones adjacent if that same borderization call triggered that should check against neighbors for this tile if needed for tile state modifications), maintaining current implementations like Tile flags on walls if some are set directly by those functions when Brush isn't a WallBrush or otherwise make Tile itself keep state which of those special properties are true when drawing in that case too since only Items with correct group/other property values appear for that tile at certain positions (ground, border, wall, if its under-ground tile rather than walls etc.; any logic from getItemRenderLayer should come to these to be simplified if now those items determine where they should get placed and in which render order they are relative to the Tile by brush rather than map drawers iteration sorting using types - so that would determine on creation which floor for instance these can exist based on item id flags loaded in Items/types) which will be needed if QMapItems must also mimic visibility for rendering for correct "has" state on layers where Tile manages visual drawing in its items and those contain the needed item attributes/layer types that now Brush uses to check when not creating/modifying Tiles after setting any type of item via `Tile::addXXXItem`-like function with the tiles update states (`ItemProperty` as flags might also be part of Tile since they are checked at MapTileItems if they mean general map state at a single Tile/position when drawing rather than single `Item` with those properties unless that means the *top* item needs additional property checks/getters for example that other parts then have to propagate to from Map rather than direct tile member flags if some visual layers show properties for instance if anything on a single location can have or set certain flags), with their methods like `isXXXX` being only getters for what it would normally read at some other data structure using Item class and methods (that getItemRenderLayer determines visibility layers, though some types might get added using different positions for specialized wall tile type etc like `wallItems`), unless some specific brush implementation wants different behaviour on its Item like using Item attributes in place now rather than passing additional Item\* if Selection's state uses those during drawing from current tile item property if those should persist at those functions that determine where exactly they should go with a new Brush using Mapviews state now for selecting what to draw/delete, or there must be multiple sets for different brush functions like filling, replacing for Selection Brush, using Tile data for that instead. Also ensure any associated attributes like "description" (used for comments on export if there's now only `itemAttributes` map to access with those key/values), item type to its properties, `weight` with or without Items attribute rather than a flag check that might no longer exist, get elevation etc for visualization later as tiles get created to test if its rendering into the correct slot for each floor with `currentItem` set using what types each panel displays. Also `setDestination`/Door ID change and item\_type usage (was TileItem properties) might trigger refresh now when it might not before in all cases, implement appropriate calls for example for minimap rather than that monitoring the Tiles, ensuring also those signals are in `project_qt` if Tile or other objects/parts need notification when its modified to recompute `isXXXX()` from item attributes even without map modifications.
