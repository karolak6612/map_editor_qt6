**Task72: Migrate remaining rendering code in `map_drawer` to `QGraphicsView` (SFML/OpenGL Replacement, Selection Boxes, Brush/Doodad Custom Drawing)**
- Task: **Migrate any remaining rendering code from `wxwidgets::map_drawer` (or equivalent custom drawing orchestrator), particularly code that might have used direct SFML or OpenGL calls (if any for effects not covered by `wxDC`), to the `QGraphicsView` / `QPainter` paradigm in `Project_QT`. This includes ensuring selection boxes, brush previews, and any custom doodad drawing is now handled within Qt's rendering system.**
    - **Analyze Existing `MapView` Rendering:** Review `Project_QT/src`'s `MapView` and `MapScene` to identify what custom drawing (if any) still needs porting beyond standard `QGraphicsItem::paint()` calls.
    - **Replacement of SFML/OpenGL:**
        -   If `wxwidgets` used SFML or direct OpenGL calls for certain effects in `map_drawer` (e.g., custom shaders, specific blending modes, advanced primitives for selection boxes or previews), this logic must be replaced:
            -   Ideally, achieve similar effects using `QPainter` operations on `QGraphicsItem`s or `MapView`'s foreground/background drawing.
            -   `QGraphicsEffect` can be used for some shader-like visual effects on items.
            -   For very complex OpenGL-specific rendering, investigate `QOpenGLWidget` or drawing into a `QOpenGLFramebufferObject` if parts of the scene *must* remain in OpenGL (but prefer native `QPainter` where possible).
    - **Selection Box Rendering:** Ensure selection boxes (the visual rectangle or highlight showing the current selection area from Task 61) are drawn correctly. This might be handled by a dedicated `SelectionItem` (`QGraphicsItem` from Task 58) or by custom drawing in `MapView::drawForeground()`.
    - **Brush Preview Drawing:** Finalize brush preview drawing (building on Task 65). If any brushes had very custom preview logic in `map_drawer` (beyond simple shapes), port that logic to `QPainter` and ensure it's invoked correctly by `MapView` when a brush is active.
    - **Doodad Drawing (if special):** If "doodads" or other special map elements had unique drawing routines in `map_drawer` not covered by their standard `Item::draw()` method (e.g., for animated previews in a palette or complex editor-only visuals), port this to Qt.
    - **Inlined Ground Tile Drawing (`DrawingOptions`):** If the original `map_drawer` had optimized logic for drawing ground tiles directly using colors from `DrawingOptions` (e.g., a "simple render mode"), ensure this capability is preserved or correctly mapped to `Tile::draw()` / `MapTileItem::paint()`.
    - **`Blit*` calls:** Any direct blitting operations from `wxwidgets` (e.g., `wxDC::Blit`) must be replaced with `QPainter::drawPixmap` or similar.
    - **Updating `QGraphicsView` Drawing (`paint()` overrides):** If `MapView` (subclass of `QGraphicsView`) needs to override `paintEvent()` or `drawBackground()` / `drawForeground()` for these custom effects, implement that logic here. Avoid keeping custom drawing logic directly in `MainWindow` if `MapView` is the appropriate place.
    - **Hover Indicators:** How `MapCanvas` or `map_drawer` handled hover indicators (e.g., highlighting a tile or item under the mouse) needs to be ported. This might involve `QGraphicsItem::hoverEnterEvent/hoverLeaveEvent` for individual items, or `MapView` tracking `mouseMoveEvent` and drawing temporary highlights. This interacts with `MapItems` properties on `MapView`.
    - **`Task72.md` must identify any specific SFML/OpenGL drawing calls from `wxwidgets map_drawer`, the precise behavior of selection box rendering, custom brush/doodad previews, and how hover effects or inlined tile drawing was implemented.**
