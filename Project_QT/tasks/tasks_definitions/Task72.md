**Task72:**
Migrate remaining rendering code in map_drawer to QGraphicsView including any brush/doodad drawing if implemented via OpenGL calls using now QPainter in Project_QT to render selection boxes. Maintain behavior for preview/final drawing like inlined ground tile drawing using color from DrawingOptions, Blit\* calls in those specific cases; update as required QGraphicsView drawing code (`paint()`) rather than keeping them on MainWindow to have `MapView` use Tile and Items->draw implementation now from its cache or by generating one if the view needs additional information or its from another floor if there were such special cases as when g_settings for `transparent_floors` applied using tile/ground properties like wxwidgets had in draw if needed for visibility tests when drawing or `Tile::draw` directly using QGraphicsItem properties like boundingRects handles the hover indicators based on MapItems properties on map view similar to older behavior with different drawing color and if its inside the boundingRect/selection area or current pos if in DrawingMode or simply hovered by cursor for selection which implies a bit different logic unless selection also shows similar brush outline marker in draw or hover gets handled separately from mouse rather than from Item class itself (that was a callback/event), where those items have special functions now if using an inlined `MapCanvas` cursor as hover outline rather than the View checking them at `MouseMove`/paint operations.
