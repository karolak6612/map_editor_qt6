**Task60: Implement File Handling and Version Conversion for `Map` (OTBM)**
* Migrate map's OTBM load/save functionality (`map.cpp`) for proper serialization using internal structure and other item handling logic now, mirroring Tile data, using proper node types. If items/doodads/spawn/house files have their format via existing or a new Tile node implement similar saving/loading/serialization via `IOTBM::writeTileset`/TileInfoNode rather than generic property maps as Items\_OTBM had if its more clear where those are read, e.g. ItemAttribute map from tile or Item properties unless both have that key if attributes and types must be handled similar ways during read from file (that getItemTypeName reads `type` string and there might be a ItemId in item properties or from specific object's methods similar to doorType/teleport destinations that then determine item specific drawing information based on the ID or type stored, and tile holds basic items and potentially the "has complex item", rather than all the variations and attributes if they are saved only via serialization or a default/zero if it doesn't apply to make attributes similar rather than checking or maintaining extra flags that aren't relevant from any specific tiles like whether house is a `guildhall`/not like map->`Houses` might determine if an item type is a certain item. Tiles seem to update these on each operation; no extra notify step might be necessary unless theres also mapChanged signal, or the new undoStack manages all like in older actions, since the `tile_change` seems directly handled by those items and that function simply indicates `mapView` for wx versions should do a refresh to avoid constant repaint and potentially checking those items which seems similar but less verbose when tile now handles visibility logic but not for internal flags based on current zoom level, selection in display in `MapCanvas`/MapTab) as needed when its only in view tilesets and items are shown and similar `tile_modified` might need separate tracking/update from items themselves too if thats not handled via Tile, adding handling if appropriate for waypoints/items on specific types of tile/map locations/zone attributes when converting as the map properties get set there rather than via individual tiles (like houses/towns added via new House class that adds items on Map that were using ids previously. Waypoint and town creation from tile likely will require dedicated method using Map data similar to Houses, etc)  to a simple name/key if using String-style setters/properties rather than `house_tilesets` for which the new HouseBrush then gets replaced with generic one using currentItems properties like other types, using position only unless they have internal structure too like Spawn now using Tile positions if they are supposed to represent their range and not item properties like `tile` flags) on file format write using its members to provide more targeted/clean interface.
