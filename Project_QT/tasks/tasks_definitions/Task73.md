**Task73: Port House and related operations using new system**
Implement functions that interact directly with map data in project_qt for houses using either existing panels/actions. Check all `Tile` updates (e.g., those using house exits etc if `map.h`'s Tile functions use these for tile->has* checks based on which House ID was on that tile which seem to have triggered full `HouseTile` recalculations to prevent duplicates during `Tile` level manipulations when modifying those from house selection view as map changes and its effects). Move all tile/item logic for drawing (`cleanhouseItems`) into proper editor actions (`cleanupMap`) similar to doodadBrush or other tile-level effects after processing if applicable in cleanTiles if its called at "validate selection", etc, after clearing. Handle other changes using Actions like earlier steps if editing houses involves tile property change/item replacements rather than a full overwrite; or if a dedicated Properties menu using its members does house level attributes there and directly places/updates its corresponding TileItem when editing an existing houses information rather than its position/items getting created or moved, requiring MapCanvas or Main Window refresh calls using `mapUpdated`, or map directly emitting signals about `tiles_changed`/range where these are relevant (at a viewport when showing them rather than across multiple floors where only the actively drawn has valid data using Tile cache now if only visible ground items are rendered to ensure performance remains acceptable.)
