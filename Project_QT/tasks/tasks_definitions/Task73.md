**Task73: Port `House` and related operations using new system (Full Map Data Interaction, Tile Updates, Cleanup Actions)**
- Task: **Implement functions that interact directly with map data in `project_qt` for houses, using the `House` data model (Task 66/86) and new Qt-based panels/actions. Ensure all `Tile` updates related to houses (e.g., setting `HouseID`, marking exits) are correctly handled, and house-related cleanup operations are ported as proper editor actions.**
    - **Analyze Existing House Interaction:** Review `Project_QT/src` for current `House` system interaction points with `Map` and `Tile`.
    - **Direct `Map` Data Interaction:**
        -   All operations related to creating, deleting, or modifying `House` objects must now directly update the `Map`'s list of `House`s and associated `Tile` properties (e.g., `Tile::setHouseID()`, `Tile::setHouseExit(bool)`).
        -   Port logic from `wxwidgets map.h`'s `Tile` functions that checked `Tile->has*` based on `HouseID` â€“ these checks will now use `Tile::getHouseID()` or equivalent.
    - **Tile Updates:**
        -   When a house exit is set or cleared on a `Tile`, or when a tile is added/removed from a house, ensure the `Tile` object is correctly updated and emits its `tileChanged()` signal.
        -   If original `HouseTile` recalculations were triggered to prevent duplicates during `Tile` level manipulations (e.g., when modifying houses from a house selection view), port this logic to ensure data integrity within the `Map`'s house data.
    - **Cleanup Logic as Editor Actions (`cleanupMap`):**
        -   Migrate logic like `cleanhouseItems` (if this removed invalid house items or visual clutter related to houses) into proper editor actions (e.g., a `CleanupHouseDataCommand` or as part of a more general `cleanupMap` action). This should be distinct from `DoodadBrush` or other tile-level effects unless directly related.
        -   If `cleanTiles` was called at "validate selection" and affected house-related items, port this as an action.
    - **Interactions with Property Editors:** When a house's properties are edited in a `HousePropertiesPanel` (from Task 86/94), these changes must commit to the `House` object, then propagate to the `Map` and relevant `Tile`s, triggering UI refreshes (e.g., `MapView` drawing house borders/names, `Minimap` updates). Use `mapUpdated` signals or `tiles_changed` for specific tile ranges.
    - **Handling TileItem Logic:** If house-specific visual elements or behaviors were previously handled by `Tile` having multiple distinct `Item`s for each house property, this task needs to consolidate that into actions that update the `House` object or primary `Tile` properties/attributes directly, with the rendering system then reflecting these changes. This aims for faster change management via undo/redo.
    - **Visible Ground Items Rendering:** Ensure that when house editing occurs, rendering of `MapTileItem`s respects which ground items are visible, to prevent performance issues, especially if changes span multiple floors. `Tile` caching logic needs to be robust.
    - **`Task73.md` must specify all `wxwidgets` functions and event handlers that modified house data on the map or tiles, how tile states (like exits, IDs) were updated, and the full logic of any cleanup operations like `cleanhouseItems` or `validate selection` related to houses.**
