**Task45: Create `ItemPropertyEditorBase` and Subclasses (Abstract Editor UI Structure)**
- Task: **Create an abstract base class `ItemPropertyEditorBase` (likely inheriting `QWidget`) in `project_qt`. This will serve as the foundation for UI panels or dialogs that edit properties of different types of items or map elements.**
    - **Analyze Existing Property Editors:** Review any existing property editor UIs or base classes in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **`ItemPropertyEditorBase` Interface:** Define necessary pure virtual (or virtual with default no-op) methods for this base class, such as:
        -   `virtual void setEditingObject(QObject* object) = 0;` (or a more specific type like `Item*`, `Tile*` if editors are specialized early). This method provides the object whose properties are to be displayed/edited.
        -   `virtual void loadPropertiesFromObject() = 0;` (to populate UI controls from the object).
        -   `virtual void savePropertiesToObject() = 0;` (to apply UI control values back to the object).
        -   `virtual bool hasPendingChanges() const;`
        -   Possibly methods like `setProperty(const QString& key, const QVariant& value)` and `getProperty(...)` if it directly manipulates object properties rather than just UI.
    - **Derived Stub Subclasses (`ItemPropertyEditor`, `OldPropertiesWindow`):**
        -   Derive two initial Qt widget classes: `ItemPropertyEditor` (intended for editing general `Item` attributes) and `OldPropertiesWindow` (if this was a distinct editor in `wxwidgets` with a specific layout/purpose to be preserved) from `ItemPropertyEditorBase`.
        -   For this task, these subclasses should be stubs: they have the class structure and inherit the interface, but their constructors might only create a basic placeholder UI (e.g., a `QLabel` saying "Item Property Editor Stub").
    - **Goal:** The focus is on establishing the *abstract structure and common interface* for property editors. Full UI implementation and data binding for the subclasses will occur in later, more specific tasks.
    - **Property Handling Approach:** These editors will eventually handle property edits through their GUI, which are updated based on property states (attributes, text/names) corresponding to the existing item types or the selection state from `MapView`.
    - **`Task45.md` should describe the common functionalities expected from all property editors in `wxwidgets` and any specific distinctions between `ItemPropertyEditor` and `OldPropertiesWindow` if they were conceptually different.**
