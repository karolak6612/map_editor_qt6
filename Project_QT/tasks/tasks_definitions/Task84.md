**Task84: Implement Map Loaders and Converters**
- Migrate the actual Map format reading/writing from BinaryFile to Qt for all known types with their specific format based conversion functions, handling file name extension validation via filename to identify format on open dialog (FileName class or `g_settings`), preserving behavior and loading correct `map`/tile structure if they require a map-level update to create waypoints and any missing items, and update the MapCanvas items states (`draw`) for those tiles rather than relying on Map items being used with Brush during initialization from where there's likely appropriate function calls now based on position rather than having Selection add any kind or update if only the tiles within bounding box are affected using `addPositions`/`setRangeForXXX` using tile selection changes as needed or some tile type checks like border creation before via Selection. Also correctly translate those parts in tile.h-tile.cpp that have special function in IO (`setCollision`), handle as separate TileFlags with appropriate attributes/setters/methods based on whats currently used as tile selection changes no longer call these rather the drawing functions do.
