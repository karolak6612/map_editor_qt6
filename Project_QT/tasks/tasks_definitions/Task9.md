**Task9: QToolBar Conversion for MainToolbar**
- Migrate the `MainToolBar` using `QToolBar` (for a primary non-dockable toolbar if `mainToolBar` was always a separate toolbar in the `wx` version), using `QAction`s with `QIcon` support, similar to how the menu was created in Step 8. Consider integrating zoom controls (either `QSlider` or `QSpinBox`) and a layer selector (combo box) directly onto this main `QToolBar` or a new `QToolBar`, updating related logic to propagate layer/zoom changes, mirroring toolbar section visibility management if this was controlled by a manager like `wxAuiManager`. For now, connect actions to dummy slots in `MainWindow`, and properly ensure `ToolBarID` logic is migrated either via direct enum/string property setting of toolbar groups if they will remain distinct OR with a dummy placeholder handler function in `MainWindow` for visibility switching.
