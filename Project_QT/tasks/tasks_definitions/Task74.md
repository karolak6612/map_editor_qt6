**Task74: Port Waypoint drawing code, and functionality for clicking.**
Update mouse click action listeners/implement mouse over tooltip text similar to how the Wx waypoints had. If there's both generic Waypoint for navigation/AI, and an Item property type named similar ensure `tile::draw()` is now handling correct marker rather than Brush needing to handle specific drawing using map level (`tiles[x][y]`) if there's no longer explicit marker placement by it like similar `Spawn`s/zones get. Update existing handlers and create stub classes in qt if some special editor type methods now got moved (`TileEditorWaypoint::OnXXXClick` likely to MainWindows, for updating maps etc, ensuring tiles that have been modified after those operations have an action assigned like TileSelection seems done rather than directly drawing tile into Map if those now might imply additional visual effects. Add map->updateWaypoint calls where relevant).
