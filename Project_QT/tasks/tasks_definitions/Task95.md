**Task95: Complete and Refine `SelectionBrush` (Including Transformations).**
Handle interaction like what wx did with modifier key events as those determine selection (`startDrag`) rather than just `MouseClick` from `map_display`. Create actual transformations similar to MapView-`DrawInternal`, unless now selection only adds items via new Brush logic or is fully managed by an object selection and transform that creates items (in map, like how Brush might, then update QGraphicsView's tiles in bounds similar to paste logic as items add likely signals changes using either Tiles' attributes if that has Item flags set after edit using Tile as central unit there or from an event/brush draw that maps uses to determine modifiedTiles rather than just those that Selection contains directly).
