**Task4: Basic `wxPanel` to `QWidget` Transition (Containers for Simple Layouts & Hierarchy)**
- Task: **Migrate `wxPanel` classes that primarily serve as simple containers for other widgets and whose main purpose is layout management (i.e., they exhibit minimal to no complex custom event handling directly within the panel itself, nor custom drawing logic beyond what standard panel styling provides) to Qt's `QWidget` or, if appropriate for visual styling (like borders), `QFrame`.**
    - **Analyze Existing Code:** Review existing `QWidget`-based container implementations in `Project_QT/src`. Identify any common patterns, base container widget classes, or established layout conventions that should be reused or adhered to.
    - **Sizer to Layout Replacement (Comprehensive):** Systematically replace all associated `wxwidgets` sizers (`wxBoxSizer`, `wxGridSizer`, `wxFlexGridSizer`, `wxGridBagSizer`, `wxStaticBoxSizer`, etc.) with their closest functional equivalents in Qt's layout system (`QVBoxLayout`, `QHBoxLayout`, `QGridLayout`, `QFormLayout`). `wxStaticBoxSizer` often maps to a `QGroupBox` containing a layout.
    - **Accurate Layout Migration:** Ensure correct and precise migration of layouts from the `wxwidgets` source code or UI definition files (XRC if used). This involves:
        -   Replicating the intended visual arrangement of child widgets.
        -   Translating sizer flags related to proportion (`proportion`), expansion (`wxEXPAND`), alignment (`wxALIGN_LEFT`, `wxALIGN_CENTER_VERTICAL`, etc.), and borders (`border`) to their corresponding Qt layout item properties (stretch factors, alignment flags, spacing, margins).
        -   Maintaining the correct parent-child widget hierarchy.
    - **Scope Limitation:** This task is specifically for panels whose complexity is primarily in their layout of standard child controls. Panels that implement significant custom `EVT_PAINT` handlers for their own appearance, or complex `EVT_MOUSE_EVENTS` (etc.) for direct interaction, will be handled in later, more specialized migration tasks.
    - **Refer to `Task4.md` for illustrative examples of `wxPanel` types that fall under this "simple container" definition and common Qt layout strategies and property mappings to achieve functional and visual parity.**
