**Task52: Integrate Automagic Borders with Qt's Rendering System**
Task: Seamlessly integrate automatic border generation from `BorderSystem` into the `QGraphicsView` based rendering (`MapScene`, `MapView`) after creating or removing ground/terrain tiles. Add mechanisms to request visual updates of MapScene only in visible map areas using Tile coordinates affected and tile->neighbor information and the Qt Signal system for map modification updates like on `setTile`/add-remove rather than re-creating and re-calculating all items every redraw at Draw (similar to MapViews `refreshView` using `DrawRectange` as temporary bounding rectangle representation with border tile for groundBrush to test using an `IsSelectedTile`/similar visual helper on the new graphics items to know how those looked for this tileset).
