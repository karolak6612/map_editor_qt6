**Task52: Integrate Automagic Borders with Qt's Rendering System (Visual Updates post-Terrain Edit)**
- Task: **Seamlessly integrate automatic border generation from `BorderSystem` (stubbed or partially developed from Task 18) into the `QGraphicsView`-based rendering system (`MapScene`, `MapView`) so that visual updates to borders occur *after* ground/terrain tiles are created or removed via brush actions.**
    - **Analyze Existing Border System:** Review current state of `BorderSystem` and `MapView` rendering in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Triggering `BorderSystem`:**
        -   When a brush action conceptually modifies a ground/terrain `Tile` (e.g., via `Map::setTile()` or an `AddItemCommand` that places ground), this change should trigger a call to the `BorderSystem`.
        -   `BorderSystem` should then analyze the affected `Tile` and its neighbors to determine what border `Item`s need to be added, removed, or changed on those tiles. (The actual logic for `BorderSystem` determining border types is developed here or in dedicated `BorderSystem` tasks).
    - **Visual Update Mechanism:**
        -   After `BorderSystem` determines the necessary border item changes for a set of tiles, `MapView` needs to visually update *only* those affected tiles and their immediate surroundings within the visible map area.
        -   This should utilize the Qt Signal/Slot system for map modification updates (e.g., `Map` emits `tilesChanged(const QList<QPoint3D>& updatedTileCoords)`).
        -   `MapScene` or `MapView` listens to this signal and requests updates for the corresponding `MapTileItem`s, rather than re-creating or re-calculating all items/tiles on every screen redraw.
    - **Conceptual Rendering of Borders:** If a `GroundBrush` operation from `wxwidgets` used a temporary bounding rectangle or similar visual helper for border tiles during placement (e.g., `DrawRectangle` to test using `IsSelectedTile`), ensure that the new system allows for similar preview or that `MapTileItem`s correctly reflect their new border items quickly for visual feedback.
    - **Interaction with `Tile` and `Map`:** The `BorderSystem` will read `Tile` data (ground types, existing items) and likely modify `Tile`s by adding/removing border `Item`s (via `Tile::addItem/removeItem` which should then signal `Map`).
    - **Focus:** This task is about the *integration and visual update flow*. `Map -> TerrainChange -> BorderSystemCalculation -> MapModification (BorderItems) -> Signal -> MapView/MapSceneUpdate`. The complex internal logic of `BorderSystem` itself deciding *which* border item to place is substantial but developed in concert here.
    - **`Task52.md` should detail how `wxwidgets` triggered border updates, what information `BorderSystem` (or equivalent) needed, how tile neighbor information was accessed, and how visual updates were confined to affected areas rather than full redraws.**
