**Task62: Full Migration of wxFrame, menus, and wxAUI (if used) to Qt Main Window and related panels**
- Replace main Frame code with QMainWindow, handling window event like close. Finalize wxAuiNotebook handling using Qt signal mechanisms; notebook tabs switching would call setSelection, mapView refresh events similarly using UpdateTab, Tab-specific view like View Mode or Floor toggle when selection or drawmode from any toolbars (`palette`) update using new signals; CreateXXXToolbar as separate QObjects or implement similar helper structures with functions in MainWindow if they do NOT need tracking state changes or get tied to generic actions themselves (those triggered directly in the window where created or they have signals like ToolBars has when item in toolwindow or toolPanels get selected, similar for layers list on tile change in MapPanel from wxWidgets that were in map_windows when changing active layers using `updateFloor`, which ideally could send currentLayer to statusBar if the QStatusBars show layer in qt also similar to what Tile/item specific attributes in selection that shows when available such items/ground when selected if those need special properties menu to control like doors or unique\_items have from tiles in `map_display.cpp/MapPopupMenu` to allow those states updates from those context on both Tile's data attributes in Map itself after any modifications if appropriate. Any of item\_properties related windows likely go now as panels/widgets if theres multiple EditorTabs rather than being the MainWindow if we try maintaining general approach for opening specific panels based on Tab selection like selection dialog was done if its tied to editor mode only). Add mechanism to connect tool panels, `StatusBar`, menus to Map for updates (to mapWindow via events from Mainwindow if those can update selection like in wx). Focus `MainWindow` class. Any generic display and settings related to rendering in MapCanvas and properties like selection border are likely from view rather than an item specific parameter to use Tile data (where `getGroundBrush`/etc determine rendering logic if implemented).
