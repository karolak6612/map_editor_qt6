**Task62: Full Migration of `wxFrame` (main window), menus, and `wxAUI` (if used for main layout) to Qt `QMainWindow` and related panels (Complete UI Shell & Basic Wiring)**
- Task: **Replace the main `wxFrame` code with `QMainWindow` in `project_qt`. This includes fully integrating the `QMenuBar` (Task 8), `QToolBar`(s) (Task 9/46), `QStatusBar` (Task 30), and `QDockWidget` panels (Task 10 for core UI layout, previously `wxAuiNotebook` or `wxAuiManager` panes). Ensure window event handling and basic tab/panel interaction logic are in place.**
    - **Analyze Existing `QMainWindow`:** Review and complete the `MainWindow` class in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **`QMainWindow` Structure:**
        -   Set the `QMenuBar` as the main window's menu bar.
        -   Add all `QToolBar`s to appropriate toolbar areas.
        -   Set the `QStatusBar`.
        -   Add and arrange all core `QDockWidget`s for palettes, properties, minimap, etc., to achieve the primary application layout.
        -   If `wxAuiNotebook` was used for tabbed map views or editor views, replace it with `QTabWidget` as the central widget or within a `QDockWidget`.
    - **Window Event Handling:** Implement `QMainWindow::closeEvent(QCloseEvent *event)` to handle application shutdown (e.g., prompting to save unsaved changes â€“ stubs for now).
    - **Tab/Panel Interaction (Basic Wiring):**
        -   If using `QTabWidget` for multiple map views: connect its `currentChanged(int index)` signal to a slot in `MainWindow` or `MapViewManager`. This slot should:
            -   Conceptually set the "active" `Map` or `MapView`.
            -   Trigger a placeholder `MapView::refreshView()` or `MapView::updateSelectionDisplay()`.
            -   Update other UI elements (like `StatusBar` or layer controls) based on the new active tab/map.
        -   If switching tool panels (dock widgets) or changing selections within them (e.g., selecting a new layer in a layer panel, a new brush in a brush palette) was meant to update the main `MapView` or `StatusBar`, ensure these panel signals are connected to appropriate `MainWindow` slots for basic event propagation (e.g., `MainWindow::activeLayerChanged(int layer)`).
    - **Restoring UI State:** Ensure `QMainWindow` layout (dock widget positions, sizes, visibility, toolbar positions) is saved/restored using `QMainWindow::saveState()` and `restoreState()` with `QSettings` (full persistence is Task 97, stubs for now). This replaces `wxAuiManager` perspective saving if it handled this.
    - **Goal:** Create the complete shell of the main application window with all its primary UI components (menus, toolbars, status bar, dockable panels) correctly laid out and basic interaction for switching views or receiving updates from panels conceptually in place. Full functionality within each panel/view is covered by other tasks.
    - **`Task62.md` is crucial for providing the complete layout of the original `wxFrame` managed by `wxAuiManager` or similar, the names and default states of all dockable panes/notebooks, how tab switching affected application state, and how panels communicated changes back to the main frame or map view.**
