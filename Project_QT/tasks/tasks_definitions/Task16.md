**Task16: Migrate CreatureManager basic file handling**
- Implement `CreatureManager` to use Qt's XML handling (`QXmlStreamReader`) for creature property file loading/saving (`creatures.xml`) from data, retaining CreatureProperties info structure using new Outfit data class. Ensure correct storage in QMap using `CreatureType::ID` key, as well as optionally ID by Name lookup based on if the wxWidgets database or loader might attempt getTypeName lookup first for creatures.  Replace generic CreatureList/wxWidgets collections with Qt's QVector or similar. Implement `getCreatureProperties()` which gives base stats via a non-owning ptr to property. Focus now primarily on the data storage. Access by name (`wxwidgets::creatures.cpp`) seems secondary (if necessary for conversion); numeric ID should be primary lookup if creature data stores that.
