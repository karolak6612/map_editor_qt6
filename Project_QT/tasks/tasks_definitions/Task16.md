**Task16: Migrate `CreatureManager` basic file handling (XML Parsing & Property Storage)**
- Task: **Implement `CreatureManager` in `project_qt` to use Qt's XML handling (`QXmlStreamReader`) for loading and potentially saving creature property files (typically `creatures.xml` from the data directory), as specified in `Task16.md`.**
    - **Analyze Existing Code:** Build upon or refactor any existing `CreatureManager` found in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Data Structure:** Retain the `CreatureProperties` information structure from `wxwidgets`, creating a new Qt-based `Outfit` data class (or similar struct) if `CreatureProperties` involved complex outfit/looktype information that benefits from its own structure.
    - **Storage:** Ensure correct storage of loaded `CreatureProperties` in a `QMap` (or `QHash`) using `CreatureType::ID` (enum or int) as the primary key. Optionally, implement a secondary lookup map for ID by Name if the `wxwidgets` database or loader frequently performed `getTypeName` lookups for creatures first.
    - **Collections:** Replace generic `CreatureList` or other `wxwidgets` collection types used internally with Qt's `QVector<CreatureProperties>` or similar suitable containers.
    - **Core Method:** Implement `getCreatureProperties(CreatureType::ID id) const` which returns a (const reference or non-owning pointer to) `CreatureProperties` struct, providing the base stats and information for a given creature type.
    - **Focus:** This task focuses *primarily on the data storage and retrieval of creature definitions from XML*. Access by name (if used in `wxwidgets::creatures.cpp`) is secondary if creature data stores numeric IDs; ensure numeric ID is the primary lookup.
    - **`Task16.md` must detail the structure of `creatures.xml`, the `CreatureProperties` and `Outfit` structs, and how attributes from XML map to these structs.**
