**Task14: Create `ItemManager` in Qt (Core Structure & Definition Loading from Files)**
- Task: **Migrate the `ItemManager` (basic functionality initially), concentrating on the critical aspects of loading item definitions from files using `ItemManager`'s own methods. Implement the `ItemManager` class in `project_qt`.**
    - **Analyze Existing Code:** Thoroughly analyze and build upon, or refactor, any existing `ItemManager` or item definition loading code in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Data Format & Parsing:** Use Qt's JSON handling (`QJsonDocument`, `QJsonObject`, etc.) or other preferred/original formats (e.g., DAT parsing logic like `readDatString` if that was primary for item definitions) as specified in `Task14.md`. The manager must parse item definitions from these files.
    - **Storage of Definitions:** Store the loaded item definitions (which include item properties, IDs, placeholder sprite info for now) in an internal lookup structure, typically a `QMap<int, ItemPropertiesStruct>` where `ItemPropertiesStruct` is a new Qt-based struct holding all parsed properties for an item type.
    - **Core Methods (Initial):**
        -   Implement the methods responsible for loading and parsing the item definition files.
        -   Add `ItemPropertiesStruct getItemProperties(int item_id) const` for retrieving loaded definitions.
        -   Add a stub `Item* createItem(int item_id)` method. For this task, it might just return `nullptr` or a very basic `Item` with only its ID and properties set from the loaded definition; actual robust `Item` object instantiation and linking with specific `Item` subclasses is for Task 24.
    - **Internal Maps for Game Items (`Item*`)**: The structure to hold actual game instances (`QMap<int, Item*>`) can be declared, but population and management are largely deferred or will be handled via `QGraphicsItem` palettes and brushes later.
    - **Flexibility:** Prioritize a flexible JSON object-attribute style for reading/saving item definitions if transitioning to JSON, or faithfully replicate the original DAT parsing if that's the primary goal.
    - **`Task14.md` must detail the exact file format(s) for item definitions, the structure of `ItemPropertiesStruct`, and any specific parsing routines (like `readDatString` adaptations) needed.**
