**Task32: Implement `ResourceManager` in Qt (Complete - Sprite/Icon/Texture Loading, Caching, Categorization)**
- Task: **Fully migrate the `ResourceManager` class from `wxwidgets` to `project_qt`, creating a comprehensive Qt-based system for loading, caching, and managing shared graphical resources like icons, UI element textures, and potentially generic sprites not handled by the more specialized `SpriteManager` (for game assets).**
    - **Analyze Existing `ResourceManager`:** Thoroughly review and build upon, refactor, or replace any existing `ResourceManager` or general asset loading code in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Resource Loading:** Implement robust methods for loading images (which will be stored typically as `QPixmap` or `QImage` internally) from:
        -   Filesystem paths (e.g., for editor themes, icons not part of Qt resources).
        -   Qt's resource system (`.qrc` files) for bundled assets.
        -   Support various image formats recognized by Qt (PNG, JPG, XPM, BMP, GIF, etc.).
    - **Caching Mechanism:** Implement an efficient internal caching mechanism (e.g., using `QMap<QString, QPixmap>` or `QHash`) to store loaded resources, keyed by their identifier (e.g., path, resource alias, or a unique ID). This prevents redundant loading of frequently used assets.
    - **Resource Retrieval:** Provide clear public methods to retrieve resources by their identifier (e.g., `QPixmap getPixmap(const QString& id)`).
    - **Categorization (if applicable):** If the original `ResourceManager` categorized resources (e.g., "icons," "textures," "ui_elements") or inferred type from file prefixes or naming conventions (e.g., "ground_*" for ground tile images, "border_*" for borders, "item_*" for generic item representations), replicate this categorization logic. This might involve loading resources into different internal collections or tagging them.
    - **Sprite/Image Management:** This `ResourceManager` should replicate the *complete* sprite/image management scope of the original `wxwidgets::ResourceManager`. If it handled spritesheets that were then used to extract individual sprites or icons, that logic needs porting (though actual `GameSprite` animation frames are `SpriteManager`'s domain). Ensure it can handle images of various resolutions.
    - **Thread Safety:** If the original design allowed or `Task32.md` specifies that resources might be loaded or accessed from multiple threads, ensure the `ResourceManager`'s loading and caching mechanisms are thread-safe (e.g., using `QMutex` for critical sections).
    - **Usage Context:** While `SpriteManager` handles game-specific `.spr` files, this `ResourceManager` is for more general editor assets or game assets not fitting the `.spr` format. Its loaded resources might be used by `SpriteButton` (Task 31), UI panels, `EditorSprite` (Task 26), or even as fallback images if `SpriteManager` fails. `ItemManager` might also query it for icon representations of `ItemTypes`.
    - **`Task32.md` must specify the full scope of the original `ResourceManager`, any categorization schemes, specific file naming conventions it relied on, details of any sprite sheet parsing it performed (if any), and thread safety requirements.**
