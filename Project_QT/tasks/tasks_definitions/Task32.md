**Task32: Implement `ResourceManager` in Qt (Complete)**
-   Task: Fully migrate `ResourceManager` to Qt, focusing on loading/saving sprites, icons, and textures, replicating complete sprite/image management in Qt project, potentially storing in custom structures to avoid any specific resolution requirement of `wxWidgets::loadSprites` from single-file bitmaps as ResourceManager appears more universal (icons might be standard sizes but perhaps sprites will vary by what game/format they should display or come from a raw byte format that then needs additional steps using new QImage::pixel-level access) similar to the earlier wx approach from ResourceManager (sprites or icons are loaded, but usage later would require it from SpriteManager via Item manager like wx version of Item handling does with QPixmaps, similar logic applies); Ensure thread-safe loading for potentially any resolution images at file path directory passed by using default settings (load what it can if it recognizes extension - jpg, png; if possible, categorize like RME `wxwidgets:: ResourceManager` assumed file prefixes imply icon type, unless image names now directly indicate if ground, border, tile item, creature etc.)
