**Task23: Finish `MapTileItem` drawing and logic (Full `Tile` Delegation, Caching, Selection Highlight, Collision)**
- Task: **Complete the essential drawing and interactive logic for `MapTileItem` (the `QGraphicsItem` subclass representing a single tile on the `MapScene`).**
    - **Analyze Existing `MapTileItem`:** Refactor or complete any existing `MapTileItem` in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Delegation to `Tile::draw()`:** The `MapTileItem::paint(QPainter *painter, const QStyleOptionGraphicsItem *option, QWidget *widget)` method MUST now fully delegate its core content drawing to the `Tile::draw()` method (from Task 22) of its associated `Tile` object. It will pass its `painter`, relevant `DrawingOptions` (obtained from `MapView` or `MapScene`), and its own position/context.
    - **Visual Caching (if applicable):** If the `wxwidgets` version or `Task23.md` indicates that tile rendering was cached to a temporary pixmap for optimization (especially when items at a given Z/layer haven't changed), implement this caching mechanism within `MapTileItem`. The `paint()` method would then draw this cached `QPixmap` unless a cache refresh is needed.
    - **Selection Highlighting:** Implement robust visual highlighting for the `MapTileItem` when its corresponding `Tile` is marked as selected in the `Map`'s selection state (e.g., from `Map::setSelection()`). This might involve drawing a border, an overlay color, or changing its appearance based on a property.
    - **Collision Checking Interface:** Implement the basic collision checking interface based on the `Tile`'s contents. If `DrawingOptions` specified collision properties, `MapTileItem` (or its `Tile`) should have methods like `bool isSolid()`, `bool isWalkable()` that reflect this. How this information is forwarded or used by the game logic (e.g., by the `Map` itself, or read directly by pathfinding from a cache managed by `QGraphicsScene`) should be considered as per `Task23.md`. For now, the methods should correctly reflect the state based on the `Tile`'s current items.
    - **`Task23.md` will provide specifics on any caching strategy, the exact visual appearance of selected tile highlights, and the expected interface for collision information if handled at this level.**
