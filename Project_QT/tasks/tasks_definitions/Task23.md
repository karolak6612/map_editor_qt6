**Task23: Finish `MapTileItem` drawing and logic.**
-  Migrate MapTileItem (including painting to a temporary pixmap if MapTileItem in project_qt also manages caching for optimization when items at any given position haven't changed at a given Z/layer selection), maintaining the tile highlight when selected if done here (Map::setSelection would change visual highlight state of all tiles in map), and implementing collision checking for any tile or item using collision in DrawingOptions if intended and how this gets forwarded (by Map itself, or read directly per Tile/item from the cache stored by the QGraphicsScene).
