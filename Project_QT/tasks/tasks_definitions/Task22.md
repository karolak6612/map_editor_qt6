**Task22: Migrate Tile drawing function**
- Migrate the Draw function from wxwidgets Tile, creating appropriate rendering procedures for Items and Creatures on tiles, mirroring tile drawing logic, respecting all visibility settings related to tiles and layers (`DrawingOptions`), but without sprite loading or specific ground handling yet in `Tile::draw()`. `Tile::Draw`'s main function seems to be iterating over `this->items` for rendering; later this becomes an internal cache to render to the Graphics Scene and item drawing (using actual sprites for each ItemType, handling transparency/zoom-based filtering, animations from GameSprites) is to be implemented separately. ZoneBrush can use drawText directly on Tile drawing for now, even if Map supports it too for drawing zone-text. Don't worry about specific implementations for walls, creatures, effects etc in this pass if Tile directly doesn't handle these based on specific ItemType subclasses; ensure layers logic is accounted for (items at lower levels might be hidden by ones above if no transparency effect etc) and consistent data lookup with the Tile data structures being the main access/display structure with Tile storing all visual Item and creature details if possible for simplified `MapTileItem`.
