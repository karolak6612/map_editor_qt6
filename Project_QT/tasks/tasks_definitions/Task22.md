**Task22: Migrate `Tile` drawing function (Comprehensive Item/Creature Rendering Loop & Initial Visibility)**
- Task: **Migrate the core `Draw` function logic from the `wxwidgets Tile` class into `project_qt`'s `Tile::draw(QPainter* painter, const DrawingOptions& drawingOptions, const QPointF& screenPos)` method (or similar signature). This method is responsible for orchestrating the rendering of everything *on* or *part of* this specific tile.**
    - **Analyze Existing `Tile::draw`:** If `Project_QT/src`'s `Tile` class has an existing `draw` method, this task will complete or refactor it.
    - **Rendering Loop:** Implement the primary rendering procedure, which involves iterating over the `Tile`'s contained `Item`s (`QVector<Item*>`) and `Creature`s (`QVector<Creature*>` if managed separately by the `Tile` rather than as specialized items).
    - **Calling `Item`/`Creature` Draw Methods:** For each `Item` and `Creature` in its collections, the `Tile::draw()` method must call their respective `draw(QPainter* painter, const DrawingOptions& drawingOptions, const QPointF& itemScreenPosOffset)` methods (these `Item`/`Creature` draw methods are stubs or basic implementations from earlier tasks, to be fully developed later).
    - **Visibility and Layering (Initial):**
        -   Respect all fundamental visibility settings related to tiles and conceptual layers that are passed via `DrawingOptions` (or an equivalent state object). For example, if a layer is marked invisible in `DrawingOptions`, items on that layer on the tile should not be drawn.
        -   Account for basic Z-ordering logic for items *within the tile*. The order of iteration through the item/creature vectors, or properties on the items themselves, might determine draw order (e.g., items at lower visual levels are drawn first, potentially hidden by items drawn later if no transparency is applied).
    - **Ground/Border Rendering (Conceptual):** If the original `Tile::Draw` also handled rendering the ground texture or tile borders directly (before iterating items), implement placeholder logic for this (e.g., draw a base colored rectangle). Specific ground/border texture handling is a later task (Task 54+).
    - **Scope Exclusions for this Task:**
        -   No actual sprite loading or complex texture mapping (this uses `Item::draw` which is still basic).
        -   Specific drawing implementations for walls, complex creatures with multiple parts, or visual effects are deferred (these rely on their respective `Item`/`Creature` draw methods becoming more advanced).
    - **ZoneBrush Text:** If `ZoneBrush` (from Task 57) is active and the tile has zone information, `Tile::draw()` might be responsible for directly drawing zone text (e.g., "PZ") using `painter->drawText()`, even if the `Map` class also has overarching zone display logic.
    - **`Task22.md` provides the critical logic flow from the original `Tile::Draw` function, details on how `DrawingOptions` affected visibility, the iteration order for items/creatures if specific, and how conceptual Z-ordering within a tile was determined.**
