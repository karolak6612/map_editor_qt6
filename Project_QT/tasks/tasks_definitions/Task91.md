**Task91: Migrate or recreate `TilesetWindows` functionality (Advanced Tileset Definition/Editing UI)**
- Task: **Migrate or recreate the functionality of the `TilesetWindows` (or equivalent panel/dialog from `wxwidgets`) if it was responsible for more than just displaying pre-defined tilesets (like `MainPalette` in Task 70). This task focuses on UI for *defining and editing* the `Tileset` categories themselves, or managing how items/brushes are grouped within them, interacting with `TilesetManager` (Task 67). This may involve migrating logic similar to earlier dialog examples (Task 78) if this was an advanced editor for tile properties or `Tileset` composition, particularly if it related to things like `palettedoor` behavior or how `TileLocation` flag handlers (like border calculation) were influenced by `Tileset` definitions.**
    - **Analyze Existing `Tileset` UI/Logic:** Review `Project_QT/src` for any existing `Tileset` editing UI or management beyond simple display.
    - **Determine Original Scope of `TilesetWindows`:**
        -   Was it primarily for organizing items/brushes into display categories for palettes? (This is largely `TilesetManager` + `MainPalette`).
        -   Or did it allow users to *create new* `Tileset` categories, *define properties for these categories*, dynamically add/remove `ItemType`s or `Brush` types to/from them, or configure how specific `Tileset`s interacted with map editing features (e.g., a "Door Tileset" whose items have special behavior managed via this window)?
    - **UI Implementation (if an editor):**
        -   If `TilesetWindows` was an editor, create a `QDialog` or `QWidget` panel (e.g., `TilesetEditorDialog`).
        -   UI controls would allow: creating/renaming/deleting `Tileset` categories; browsing available `ItemType`s (from `ItemManager`) and `Brush` types (from `BrushManager`) and assigning them to categories; possibly setting properties for a `Tileset` category itself if they had attributes.
    - **Interaction with `TilesetManager`:** All operations in this UI must interact with `TilesetManager` (Task 67) to modify its underlying data (e.g., `tilesetManager->addCategory()`, `tilesetManager->addItemToCategory()`).
    - **Integration with `MainPalette`:** Changes made in this `TilesetEditorDialog` should ideally signal `MainPalette` to refresh its display of categories and items.
    - **Specialized `Tileset` Logic (`palettedoor` / `TileLocation` Flags):** If `TilesetWindows` dealt with special `Tileset` types like a "door tileset" (`palettedoor`) where items within it were known to be doors and this affected how map editing (like border calculation post-draw, or `TileLocation` flag handling) worked, this complex interaction logic needs to be ported. This means understanding how associating an item with such a `Tileset` influenced behavior in `wxwidgets map-edit` routines.
    - **Consider "Missing After Moving `TileLocation` Flag Handlers":** If this implies that after migrating low-level `TileLocation` flag logic (like border calculation in `map-edit`), this `TilesetWindow` provided a higher-level abstraction or configuration for these behaviors based on `Tileset` type, that's the core functionality to capture here.
    - **`Task91.md` is crucial: it must define the full original scope of `TilesetWindows`. Was it just a palette, or an advanced editor for defining tileset categories and their item/brush contents? Did it configure behavioral properties for specific tilesets that affected map editing? What was the `palettedoor` concept?**
