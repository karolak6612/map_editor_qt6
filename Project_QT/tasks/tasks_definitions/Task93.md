**Task93: Create `Project_QT` Tile property dialog (Full Implementation: Editing All Tile Properties, Data Binding, Map Updates)**
- Task: **This task replaces the original `wxTilePropertyWindow`. Implement a fully functional `TilePropertyEditor` dialog or panel in `project_qt` that allows viewing and editing all applicable properties of a selected `Tile` (or group of selected tiles if multi-edit was supported). This involves robust data binding between UI controls and `Tile` object properties, ensuring changes correctly update the `Map` and are undoable.**
    - **Analyze Existing Tile Editor UI:** Build upon the `TilePropertyEditor` UI structure (Task 49) in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Populate with All Tile Properties:** The editor must display and allow editing of:
        -   Basic `Tile` flags (e.g., Protection Zone, NoLogout, NoPVP, Walkable, Blocking â€“ if these are direct `Tile` flags).
        -   Associated IDs: `HouseID`, `ZoneID`, `TownID`.
        -   Minimap color (`minimap_color`): Use `QColorDialog` for selection if this was a `Tile` property.
        -   Map Flags (`mapFlags`): If any global map flags (e.g., PVP type) were also editable on a per-tile override basis in `wxTilePropertyWindow`.
        -   Any other properties exposed by `wxwidgets Tile` that are still relevant for `project_qt Tile`.
    - **Data Binding & Type Handling:**
        -   When a `Tile` is selected in `MapView`, this `TilePropertyEditor` should be populated with its properties.
        -   UI controls should be appropriate for the data type (`QCheckBox` for booleans, `QLineEdit` or `QSpinBox` for numbers, `QComboBox` for enums, `QPushButton` opening `QColorDialog` for colors).
        -   When a value is changed in the UI, it must update the corresponding property on the `Tile` object (or a temporary copy if using an Apply button).
    - **Map Updates & Undo/Redo:**
        -   Changes made and applied via this editor MUST update the `Map`'s `Tile` data.
        -   These changes must be encapsulated in undoable commands (e.g., `SetTilePropertyCommand`).
        -   `Tile::tileChanged()` signals (and potentially `Map` signals) must be emitted to trigger `MapView` and `Minimap` refreshes.
    - **Interaction with `ItemAttributes` vs. `Tile` Properties:**
        -   Clarify which properties are inherent to the `Tile` itself versus derived from `Item`s on it. If `wxTilePropertyWindow` showed some properties that are now purely derived from items (e.g., "has exit item"), the new editor might display these as read-only or provide links to edit the responsible item.
        -   If editing a property in this dialog means adding/removing/modifying specific `Item`s on the `Tile` (e.g., checking "Is PZ" adds a PZ Stone item), this logic must be implemented as part of the property save.
    - **Conceptual Map Updates:** If original `isXXXX` methods directly triggered map updates after changing properties, that should now be handled by the command/signal flow. For example, ensuring values get changed on `Tile` attributes for drawing (`minimap_color`, map flags) shouldn't require extra methods if the `Tile::set*Flags` already signals appropriately. Avoid having properties in both `Tile` and `itemAttributes` unless strictly necessary from original `Items_otbm` and one is derived from the other.
    - **`Task93.md` must provide the full list of editable properties from `wxTilePropertyWindow`, their data types, UI control types used, and how changes were applied to the `wxTile` object and propagated to the map. It also needs to delineate between true `Tile`-level properties vs. those derived from items in the `wxwidgets` model.**
