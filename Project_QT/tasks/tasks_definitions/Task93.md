**Task93: Create Project_QT Tile property dialog**
This replaces wx' TilePropertyWindow to allow editing the newly created properties as exposed by Tiles similar to previous panel or window dialog creation for ItemProperties. Make sure proper types for each control (`QColor`, etc)  also using QColorDialog from wx are in there too to make sure these properties later can properly apply when there an object edit method from Item itself similar to what Selection/findSimilar in Properties window using QCheckBoxes and Spinboxes. If tile directly now updates map after changing those, no extra method or function should trigger that (though those like isXXXX likely should ensure the value gets changed on tile attributes as well for drawing, including `minimap_color`, mapFlags when relevant rather than adding for everything in `Items_otbm` if not applicable or having both Tile property and `itemAttributes` as similar properties where applicable but having some use Tile or item flags depending which would have needed a generic update logic like "tile/map needs refreshing based on these flags and tiles or a boundingBox or if it concerns specific Item property changes or an internal operation via Selection rather than tiles being changed during Map's action/draw" or directly set via set\*Flags method after any change to either TileItem/Items now or Tile::type to set flags that mapdrawer etc would be checking.)
