**Task71: Implement `Waypoints` system (Full Functionality: Data, Map Interaction, UI Panel, Minimap Markers, Persistence)**
- Task: **Migrate the complete `Waypoints` system functionality to `project_qt`. This includes finalizing the `Waypoint` data model, robust interaction with `Map` and `Tile` data, a dedicated UI panel for listing/editing waypoints, visual representation on both `MapView` and `Minimap`, and ensuring waypoints are saved and loaded correctly with the map.**
    - **Analyze Existing Waypoint System:** Build upon the `Waypoint` data class (Task 20) and UI/map stubs (Task 63) in `Project_QT/src`. Refactor or complete as needed.
    - **`Waypoint` Data Model (Finalize):** Ensure the `Waypoint` class can store all its attributes (name, position, type, textual data, connections to other waypoints if part of a pathing system) from `wxwidgets`.
    - **`Map` Integration:**
        -   `Map` class manages the list of all `Waypoint`s (`QList<Waypoint*>`).
        -   Implement methods for adding, removing, retrieving, and finding waypoints on the map.
    - **UI Panel (`WaypointEditorPanel`):**
        -   Create a dedicated UI panel (e.g., a `QDockWidget`) for managing waypoints.
        -   **List View:** Display all waypoints from the current `Map`. Allow selection.
        -   **Property Editor:** When a waypoint is selected, display its properties (name, position, text, etc.) in editable fields (`QLineEdit`, `QSpinBox`, `QTextEdit`). Changes here must update the selected `Waypoint` object and the `Map`.
        -   **Controls:** Add buttons for "Create New Waypoint," "Delete Selected Waypoint."
    - **`MapView` Interaction (`WaypointBrush` / Tool):**
        -   Implement placing/moving waypoints directly on the `MapView` using a `WaypointBrush` (from Task 56) or a dedicated waypoint tool. Clicking on the map should create a new waypoint or select an existing one at that location for editing.
    - **Visual Representation:**
        -   **`MapView`:** Use `WaypointItem` (`QGraphicsItem` from Task 58) to display waypoints on the `MapScene`. Ensure they are correctly positioned and visually distinct.
        -   **`Minimap`:** If the `Minimap` (Task 90) should also display waypoint markers, implement this.
    - **Persistence:** Ensure waypoints are saved with the map data (e.g., in the OTBM file within a dedicated waypoint node, or in a separate linked XML file if that was the original mechanism â€“ refer to `Task71.md` or original map I/O for format). Implement loading waypoints when a map is opened.
    - **Related Actions/Functionality:** Migrate any other waypoint-related actions from `wxwidgets` (e.g., "find waypoint," "go to waypoint," path creation/visualization if supported). These might be menu items or buttons in the `WaypointEditorPanel`.
    - **Updating Map & Minimap:** Ensure all operations (add, delete, move, edit) update the `Map` data, trigger appropriate signals (e.g., `map->waypointsChanged()`), and cause `MapView` and `Minimap` to refresh their waypoint visuals.
    - **`Task71.md` is critical. It must define the full scope of the original waypoint system: all data attributes, UI layout of any editor, specific map interaction behaviors (e.g., how placing worked), data persistence format, and any advanced features like pathing or linking waypoints.**
