**Task39: Implement `WallBrush` (Another Terrain Subtype)**
-  Migrate the `WallBrush` along with auto wall generation and connection mechanisms and related type conversion, maintaining door information for drawing with current preferences from `Wx::door_type`, using doorItem property similar to border\_items, though those door tiles might not belong to actual items, or check if it should store info using the ItemManager/ItemType isDoor to define, like it handles the other specialized type of walls (which should get stored using appropriate ID range flags from the old items.xml into the new ItemType property on items.cpp as it will determine proper categorization in `tile->draw`).  If some are a direct link then determine a proper default category and drawing style when `wall_alignment` was WALL\_UNDEFINED if its a direct mapping as Brush likely won't need separate logic there anymore as Tile's draw can sort the tile item data types rather than splitting all into distinct groups and brushes for various terrain item types on tiles. The wall logic of connections (via `wall_item`, `wall_alignment`, using a neighbor check similar to `doBorders`) might have interactions with Tile/ItemPlacement which requires proper handling during Tile generation by `Brush` as these set TileFlags similar to how doors seems set with tiles needing an action flag. Update wall selection/deselection behaviour; this affects map data changes, using MapSelection to set.
