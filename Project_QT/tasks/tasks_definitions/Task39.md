**Task39: Implement `WallBrush` (Terrain Subtype - Wall Placement, Connection Stubs, Door Logic)**
- Task: **Migrate the `WallBrush` class to `project_qt`, inheriting from `TerrainBrush` (Task 37) or `Brush` (Task 36) as appropriate based on its original `wxwidgets` hierarchy. This brush handles placement of wall items and conceptual auto-connections.**
    - **Analyze Existing `WallBrush`:** Integrate with or refactor any existing `WallBrush` in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **`draw()` Implementation (Wall Item Placement):** The `draw()` method should conceptually place wall items onto the target `Tile`. This includes determining the wall `ItemType`/ID to place.
    - **Auto Wall Generation/Connection (Stubs):**
        -   Include placeholder logic or stubs for auto wall generation and connection mechanisms. This involves conceptual neighbor checks (similar to `doBorders` from `wxwidgets`) to determine the correct wall piece (e.g., straight, corner, T-junction, cross).
        -   The actual generation of different wall `ItemType`s based on neighbors is deferred, but the hooks for this logic should be present.
    - **Door Information Handling:**
        -   Maintain door information conceptually when placing walls (e.g., if placing a wall segment that should later become a door, or interacting with existing doors). Use the `wx::door_type` concept (ported as an enum or property) or an `Item` property like `doorItem` (if doors are special items) as defined in `Task39.md`.
        -   Interaction with `ItemManager`/`ItemType::isDoor` to define or identify door items.
    - **`wall_alignment`:** Handle `wall_alignment` property (e.g., `WALL_UNDEFINED`, `WALL_HORIZONTAL`). If this was used for specific wall types or rendering, store it and conceptually apply it. If `Tile::draw()` later handles visual sorting of tile items, this brush may no longer need complex alignment logic if the placed `Item` itself carries alignment info.
    - **TileFlags Interaction:** If placing walls or doors involves setting specific `TileFlags` (like `Tile::isDoorway`), include placeholder calls to set these flags on the `Tile` object.
    - **Wall Selection/Deselection:** Implement stub behavior for wall selection/deselection if this `Brush` also had selection capabilities, ensuring this affects `MapSelection` data conceptually.
    - **Focus:** The `WallBrush` sets the *intent* to place a wall and provides hints for connections and door types. The `Tile`'s `draw()` method and actual `ItemPlacement` commands will later handle detailed rendering and state changes.
    - **`Task39.md` is critical for detailing original auto-wall connection algorithms, `wall_item` and `wall_alignment` usage, door types, how doors interacted with wall placement (e.g., if placing a wall over a door item changed the door type), and any `TileFlags` set by walling operations.**
