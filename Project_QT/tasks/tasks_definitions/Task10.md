**Task10: Migrate wxAuiManager docking for palettes/minimap/properties/etc.**
- Transform existing code using wxAuiManager for dynamic window layouts into the equivalent system using Qt's QDockWidget framework for tool windows (e.g. palettes, layers, minimap). Implement mechanisms for storing, loading, and switching between multiple window layouts in MainWindow for consistent session state if required. Migrate all functionality including, show/hide, resize, and float/dock behaviour. This migration directly focuses on dock windows management, e.g. palettes, property editors. Update visibility tracking with settings in the PreferencesWindow to save/load states if this existed. Focus `PaletteWindow`, `MinimapWindow`. Ensure correct docking/sizing and proper updating on resize/move/settings changes for the following panes in `MainWindow`: propertiesDock, tilelistDock, actionlistDock, toolsPanel, and minimapWindow (the others were custom palette or will use a dedicated manager later).
