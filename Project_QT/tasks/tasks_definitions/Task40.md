**Task40: Implement `WallDecorationBrush`**
-   Implement the specialized `WallDecorationBrush`, inheriting from the existing `WallBrush` from Step 39 or using that as a baseline in Project\_QT code (no longer requiring `doorType` for door decoration matching by Item or tile flags as Tile class's draw can interpret correct Z index/drawOrder rather than brush defining based on if it draws directly to specific Item categories based on type properties of that items on tile since door\_items will simply specify what items should get what ids), along with related checks and any cleanup procedures used during erasing if items now store what doodad\_brush/other specialized brushes created or put those into correct display order using internal methods/property access in tile/item rather than iterating types based on which of tile->items it matches like when trying to place an item under a mountain or if they can appear as borders in `wxTile` methods that manipulate what to remove from the old map to determine auto border and wall placement of newly created Tile with any drawing commands rather than wall brush needing to do those on its own.
