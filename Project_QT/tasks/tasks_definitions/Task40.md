**Task40: Implement `WallDecorationBrush` (Structure, Drawing Intent, Z-Order Considerations)**
- Task: **Implement the specialized `WallDecorationBrush` class in `project_qt`, inheriting from `WallBrush` (Task 39) or `Brush` (Task 36) directly, based on its relationship in the original `wxwidgets` code structure and as outlined in `Task40.md`. This brush is for placing decorative items on walls.**
    - **Analyze Existing Code:** Refactor or integrate with any relevant existing decoration brush or wall accessory logic in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **`draw()` Implementation (Decoration Placement Intent):** The `draw()` method should conceptually place wall decoration items (e.g., torches, paintings, shields) on a `Tile`, typically associated with an existing wall.
    - **Z-Index/Draw Order Deferral:** The brush does not need to manage complex Z-indexing or draw order for decorations relative to walls or other items. This logic will be handled by `Tile::draw()` (which sorts/renders items based on their properties and layers) or by the properties of the `Item`s themselves. The `WallDecorationBrush` simply indicates *what* decoration to place.
    - **No `doorType` Matching Needed:** This brush should no longer require complex logic like matching `doorType` for specific door decorations if `Tile::draw()` correctly interprets the type and placement of door items and their associated decorations based on general item properties.
    - **Interaction with Tile/Item for Removal:** Consider conceptual cleanup procedures for erasing decorations. If items store what brush created them (unlikely at this stage) or if decorations are simply specific item types, `undraw()` would remove items of this type. This also involves considering original `wxTile` methods that manipulated what to remove from the map during auto border/wall placement of newly created tiles, ensuring this brush doesn't conflict with those if they handled removing decorations during wall changes.
    - **Focus:** The primary role of this brush is to select and signal the intent to place a specific wall decoration `Item`.
    - **`Task40.md` must specify how wall decorations were chosen (e.g., from a palette), any specific categories of decorations, and if there were rules about where they could be placed relative to walls or other items that `canDraw()` should check (even if placeholder checks for now).**
