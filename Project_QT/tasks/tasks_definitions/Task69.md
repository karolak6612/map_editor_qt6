**Task69: Integrate Selection Transformation Commands (Move, Rotate, Flip).**
Implement move/rotateSelection commands and associated undo support with an operation that properly records, as the Tile was converted to have `QGraphicsView`/item properties if tilesets had an appropriate method (those like wall-table-carpet etc items get updated via a direct method now to replace withBrush which adds/clears when Item already had flags indicating the position or simply has item types rather than setting extra tile properties during border/wall check. These functions set `TileLocation` properties on items similar to previous states but with all changes if some Tile flag setters no longer exist (like modify) to maintain compatible status updates as Map itself might update its state when there are tile changes based on how Item::draw uses or should use now. Ensure any house related or position tile checks are updated with items properties after adding if appropriate such items with a new ID or update their state, unless tile determines `HouseID` itself or something triggers change events like when those property setter where on Houses with that particular tile having some id (rather than adding or changing its related tiles via direct method when those now simply update their tiles as well if houses tile set modifies positions based on which are set)). Ensure proper visual update across views using signal from map change/modification and item updates if its needed by map and similar handling during selection changes or item property modifications from palettes with undo stacks add item logic that trigger them now when they possibly didn't if done on another palette view previously on a tile, using qt specific commands similar to MoveSelection, ensuring they're compatible with undo operations (these operations like PasteTile from original might internally handle Selection/Borderization so ensure their correct integration/migration) including additional check if walls repel borders are affected and `borderize` only on request on selection modification using Map's methods with all selected if required but still allow those checks on all borders from item placements for that tile if Automagic enabled during paste/drag operations, including border edge calculations based on which neighbor/wall/items to clear using tile item index for relative position using current layers `Tile` information unless they're done by actual items and their Itemtypes rather than the tiles or that itself must account or signal when tile itself has borders which should ideally use either borderize or its own internal item type specific hasXXX-like method now as tile likely should no longer call back directly when a single tile in selection changes via an `Editor` level check unless using tile position rather than list index of all relevant Tile if something wants to apply the actual brush type (like replacing doors when wall changes using wall types and their current variant similar to BORDER\_TYPE etc. which seems replaced in GroundBrushes or its AutoBorders).
