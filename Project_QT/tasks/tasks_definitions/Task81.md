**Task81: Complete Brush Loading/Saving (XML/JSON)**
Ensure brushes data loads/saves into existing/newly implemented XML or JSON files if the intention seems maintaining both internal types like Materials with specific format/attributes if stored at the project level to differentiate if there is an order (`BrushPanel` seems to have the sorting when tiles are added now), from custom Brushes and doodads or house files that ideally save all related `Tile`/Items states as there was direct access there at the end, similar for raw types, but Tiles might not support that (eg have only Tile::itemType at certain layer or ground/borders as actual Tile/`Items`, those determined via hasX properties/`getXXXBrush()` for each possible type, rather than each specific Item type requiring both states/types at Tile items from original map/drawing if its simplified into single generic selection, using for instance brushType on Tile from TileBrush when marking or erasing those in Editor from where theres also add/erase operation to replace) with similar concerns regarding those item types that do not necessarily occupy a tile grid/floor (monsters, waypoints unless WaypointBrush replaces it in palettes/map). Also implement saving changes on any internal brush edits after finishing Brush types with the corresponding update in any property or Tileset management related code as a Tile no longer contains those or items using brush categories now but similar if Item type has those linked to some tiles/brush, that Brush::flags also indicate when to apply `map->borderize` or recompute internal `itemData` type and flags using existing conversions, ensuring correct file identification (for format) in `brushes.cpp/h` load if needed.
