**Task89: Migrate Replace Item Functionality**
.


  -  Recreate Find Similar dialog for the selection, allowing the same set of options (names, flags, replace on selection rather than on map wide findItems similar results/items or using them in selection for items of that type - which was the context there on `Map->doSearch`) as well updating all places/functions that interact now with item property getters, or their attribute functions rather than flags from items or some `Brush::propertyType`.
