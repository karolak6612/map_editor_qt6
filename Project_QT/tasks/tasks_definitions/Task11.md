**Task11: Implement `Map` Data Structure in Qt**
-   Task: Implement the `Map` class in Project_QT using Qt data structures (e.g., `QVector`, `QMap`) ensuring thread safety and preserving the core data and methods like tiles, layers, zones, spawns, houses, waypoints from the wxWidgets version. The Map should be re-designed for optimal interaction with QGraphicsView for both model storage (map dimensions, Tile properties) and later data retrieval for rendering (visible items per tile, z-ordering logic in each Tile). It's best if `Tile` can hold any number of items and creatures (dynamically added to `QVector<Item*>`, `QVector<Creature*>`) which will require additional logic to sort/iterate and display only relevant types. Focus: Migrate only the essential structure for efficient storage and data handling related to tile arrangement in maps and core operations (like getTile, addItem, removeItem, setTileSize, and generic map loading) needed to work in conjunction with tile classes for tile-based maps. `setSelection()`, transformations will be migrated later via specific Commands. Refactor any iterator (if the intent is for high performance) to return the raw `Item*` pointers, so MapDrawer and rendering in QGraphicsItems doesn't constantly call slow create operations and checks. The `wxwidgets::map.cpp/h` already has Tile item vectors, make them vectors of pointers for speed.
