**Task67: Add Tileset Management to the `ResourceManager` or create appropriate handlers to access and link both items in the correct order**
. This is how g_materials (with any extensions data, such as tile/doodad brush specific items or creatures, if possible preserving both tile collection category index based lookups in current editor and type information by category when items from file rather than maps are used to build the brush palettes if necessary rather than an `editor->Item` specific load order logic unless that maintains those files separate on Item creation, using `addToTileset`) interacted via GUI in wxWidgets version (`updateBrushes`). Consider when loading an `Item` now, it has or its associated `ItemType` does already know in which `Tileset`/`Brush`/panel or both from what is available now to reduce complexity during lookup of its itemProperties on Tiles like what the selection context and tiles there did before with itemtype for borders if possible or tileset is read once during initialization and its categories index directly refers to brushes in its associated palette similar to way old map_windows's ItemPanel had an explicit button group but this should happen once for loading any items into a tileset (`isTilesetItem` as `Brush` property that it determines based on properties where applicable with Item also similarily, to `g_tileset.create*Tileset`). 
Focus only the handling for Item-based tile information with items, actual loading is ItemManager's task.  Move Tileset creation code here, or its file read/store implementations. Use appropriate container types (or mirror the ones used in wx like `Brushes::TileSetCategory`) for Qt version.
