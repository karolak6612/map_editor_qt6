**Task44: Implement `OptionalBorderBrush`**
-  Task: Port OptionalBorderBrush to qt project, maintaining `canDraw`/`draw` behavior for gravel brush with any existing `tile->XXXBorder()` state setters (either the one Tile has, or implement now based on wx widgets source). 
The OptionalBorder might add or remove border like item that are then updated via BorderSystem, handle accordingly based on where these changes seem done in map or `BaseMap` if there should now be explicit remove calls as in older Tile operations in border management using what `borderBlock`s are available there during `Tile->borderize` if Border System now performs the additional neighbor checks as part of its "border propagation", but ensure Optional border type removal has its condition that other parts use (`cleanBorders`, Tile itself, or DrawingOptions from Draw logic), for example to always remove "IsOptionalBorder" tiles but nothing else when undoing rather than applying automagic and triggering additional border item calculations after a brush operation.
The border item or gravel placed by Optional Border needs to either exist as a tile/item with proper category from ItemProperties on tile via Brush as this type is manually added in the editor if necessary for border creation based on existing tile information rather than from `Map`. Make sure Tile also understands, it can contain this.
