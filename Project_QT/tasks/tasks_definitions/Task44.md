**Task44: Implement `OptionalBorderBrush` structure and conditional draw/undraw logic**
- Task: **Port `OptionalBorderBrush` to `project_qt`, inheriting from `Brush` (Task 36). This brush places or removes optional border-like items (e.g., gravel) based on specific conditions or user intent, potentially interacting with the `Tile`'s border state or the `BorderSystem`.**
    - **Analyze Existing `OptionalBorderBrush`:** Review and integrate with or refactor any existing logic for optional or conditional borders in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **`canDraw()` / `draw()` / `undraw()` Behavior:**
        -   Faithfully maintain the original `canDraw()` logic for determining if an optional border can be placed at a given location.
        -   The `draw()` method should place the specific "optional border" `Item` (e.g., gravel). This may involve setting specific properties on the `Tile` (e.g., via `tile->setHasOptionalBorder(true)` or by adding a specific `Item` with an "IsOptionalBorder" property/flag).
        -   The `undraw()` method should remove this optional border item or unset the corresponding `Tile` property.
    - **Interaction with `BorderSystem` / `Tile` Border State:**
        -   If `OptionalBorderBrush` adds or removes border-like items that are then further processed or updated by `BorderSystem`, ensure placeholder calls or signals are made accordingly (based on where these changes are handled in `Map` or `BaseMap` in the original, or if explicit remove calls like in older `Tile` operations for border management were used).
        -   Consider how this brush interacts with `borderBlock`s if `Tile->borderize()` now involves `BorderSystem` performing neighbor checks.
        -   The removal of an "optional border" type must have its conditions correctly implemented, distinct from general automagic bordering. For instance, "undoing" an optional border placement should only remove *that* specific item, not trigger wider border recalculations unless intended.
    - **Item Definition for Optional Border:** The border item (e.g., gravel) placed by `OptionalBorderBrush` needs to exist as a valid `Tile`/`Item` with a proper category (from `ItemProperties` on the `Tile` via the `Brush`). This type of item is typically manually added in the editor for border creation based on existing tile information, not automatically generated by the `Map`. Ensure `Tile` can also understand and correctly store/render this specific type of item.
    - **`Task44.md` needs to detail the specific item type used for optional borders, the exact conditions for `canDraw()`/`draw()`/`undraw()`, and how this brush interacted with the `Tile`'s explicit border state setters (e.g., `tile->setIsGravelBorder()`) or the broader `BorderSystem` in `wxwidgets`.**
