**Task80: Port Map Display functions**
- This refers to implementing any `MapCanvas`/map drawing and display events for wxWidget map/tile related functions like  Zoom, `GridLineDraw`. This would handle all internal view changes using Qt types to support `QGraphicsItem` now, for mouse tracking/handling (e.g. implementing MapView's position to display if a map has any additional UI markers/displays and its state at mouse move, `brush`/cursor display which now gets delegated), ensuring any zoom settings (DrawingOptions likely holds all these states now) gets set accordingly as zoom happens and its states trigger update of visual markers or map update for the changed tile rectangle unless tiles directly update them using boundingRect. Create empty events on GraphicsItems to replace similar or update only items from affected areas if that level detail for display properties not always managed through the scene. Move mouse capture (`onGain/loseMouse`, which updated MapPopupMenu state) if needed or other controls/brush events use it (for state machine transitions if they were there now after refactoring using existing qt event handlers/mouse properties as this likely is where for instance doodad dragging from selection events is if it happens on that function and sets paste flags directly, for tile highlighting states on Mouse enter/exit which then sets similar map item-tile selection in View like the older `MapCanvas`, those states likely in TileItem/DrawingOptions now, those based on actual map-selection bounding box), adjusting what item selection does now on Tile MouseClick/Doubleclick or any key-based accelerators for these (`event-Skip`) when `Brush`/Tool active/has valid target based on brush selection like any of `Tool Panel` events for current active tiles, rather than editor state checking for specific cases when theres likely now `onMapXXXXSelected` that sets property or creates an object from attributes rather than SelectionBox being in some mode at these functions in MapCanvas if Tile or View update event based item or zone specific operations handle all related visual and other updates after Tile is modified on map. Similar considerations when drawing tooltips with Brush from what is likely still QMapWindow class. Ensure also all UI or events-related settings/parameters  (`doubleclick-properties`) exist on the `qt::settingsmanager` using default type values and logic where applicable.
