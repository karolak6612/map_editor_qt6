**Task42: Migrate TableBrush**
*   Implement `TableBrush` in project_qt replicating its existing item mapping, loading any random variation data and border types, maintaining similar attributes structure for variations using tables\_items in Brushes/WallBrush as a guideline (though those stored which index was a wall/border using int, determine how these Table items use it, perhaps using Brush/item IDs directly rather than types for tiles) adjusting to what's appropriate now given other brush functionality. Ensure Item placement or Item properties for table brushes is in line with the newer draw operations like if it removes old/cleans tables from tile based on its logic for table brushes in Map editing function; also correctly handle or create tile conversion methods like tableize in qt project if tile or other mechanisms do those tile calculations via other helper class than `brush`.
