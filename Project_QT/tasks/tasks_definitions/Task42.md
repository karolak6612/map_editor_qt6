**Task42: Migrate `TableBrush` structure, item mapping, variations, and interaction logic**
- Task: **Implement the `TableBrush` class in `project_qt`, inheriting from `Brush` (Task 36). This brush is responsible for placing table items, potentially with variations and specific border/connection logic.**
    - **Analyze Existing `TableBrush`:** Review and integrate with or refactor any existing table-related brush or item placement logic in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Item Mapping and Variations:**
        -   Replicate its existing item mapping logic for placing different parts of a table or table types.
        -   Handle any random variation data if tables could be placed with different appearances or constituent items based on chance or brush settings (e.g., different tablecloths, items on the table).
        -   Manage border types or connection logic if tables needed to connect to each other or align with walls. Use the `tables_items` concept from `Brushes/WallBrush` as a guideline for how these item variations or connection parts were originally stored/indexed (e.g., if indices indicated a wall/border using `int`, determine how `TableBrush` uses this, perhaps using direct Brush/item IDs or relative position checks for neighbors).
    - **Attributes Structure:** Maintain a similar attribute structure for variations as in `wxwidgets`, adjusting to Qt data structures (e.g., `QList<TableVariationStruct>`).
    - **`draw()` Method Implementation (Conceptual Item Placement):**
        -   The `draw()` method should conceptually place the table `Item`(s) on the target `Tile`.
        -   This involves selecting the correct table `ItemType` or variation based on brush settings or randomization logic.
        -   Include placeholder logic for any specific tile cleanup or preparation that was part of table placement in `wxwidgets` (e.g., removing old table items, ensuring clear space).
    - **Tile Conversion Logic (`tableize`):** Correctly handle or create placeholder Qt methods for any "tableize" logic if this was a function in `wxwidgets` `tile.cpp` or other helper classes that calculated how table segments should connect or orient based on neighbors. This logic might be part of `canDraw()` or called by `draw()` before placing items.
    - **Integration with Newer Draw Operations:** Ensure item placement or setting of `Item` properties for table items by this brush is compatible with the newer model of drawing operations and commands.
    - **`Task42.md` must detail the original `TableBrush`'s item mapping, how variations were defined and chosen, the logic for `tableize` or neighbor-based connections, and any specific properties the brush itself managed.**
