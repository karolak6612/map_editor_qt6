**Task24: Integrate `Item`'s Type System with `ItemManager` (Full Typed `Item` Creation & Properties)**
- Task: **Complete the integration of the `Item` type system with `ItemManager`, ensuring `ItemManager` can create correctly typed `Item` objects with type-specific properties and behaviors.**
    - **Analyze Existing `Item` and `ItemManager`:** Build upon the structures from Task 13 (Item) and Task 14 (ItemManager) in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Typed Item Creation:** `ItemManager::createItem(itemId)` should now:
        -   Lookup the `ItemType` (enum or detailed type definition) from its loaded item definitions (which now include comprehensive type information beyond just an ID).
        -   Instantiate the correct specialized `Item` class (e.g., `TeleportItem`, `ContainerItem`, `DoorItem` if these inherit from `Item`) OR instantiate a base `Item` and configure it with detailed type-specific data structures/behaviors based on the `ItemType`.
        -   The created `Item` object must now fully embody its type.
    - **Type-Specific Properties:** Correctly read and assign all type-specific properties to the `Item` during its creation, using information from `ItemManager`'s loaded definitions. This includes not just basic flags but also data for complex types (e.g., teleport destination coordinates, container capacity/content, door linked IDs, etc., as detailed in `wxwidgets` items.h/items.cpp and specified by `Task24.md`).
    - **`Item::Create_OTBM` Logic:** Port or adapt the logic from `wxwidgets Item::Create_OTBM` (if applicable) or similar functions responsible for instantiating items from specific data formats, ensuring all item type-specific data is correctly initialized based on server IDs from `.otb` files rather than relying solely on special ID ranges (if the original did that for some types). The `Item` class, configured by `ItemManager`, will now manage all these complex types.
    - **Missing Type Properties:** Systematically review the original `items.h`/`items.cpp` for any type-specific properties or behaviors not yet represented in the `Project_QT/src` `Item` class or its potential subclasses. Implement these so they are directly known and managed by `Item` to handle conversions or interactions based on actual item server IDs if needed.
    - **`Task24.md` is crucial here: it must provide the full hierarchy of specialized item types from `wxwidgets`, their specific properties, how these properties were stored/accessed, and how server IDs map to these types and properties, especially for complex items like teleports, containers, doors, etc.**
