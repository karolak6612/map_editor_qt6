**Task24: Integrate Item's Type System with ItemManager.**
- Complete Item, handling proper type checking using specialized Item classes based on `Item::Type` enum. `Item::create()` now returns the right type. Correctly integrate properties in `Item` read/creation using the corresponding classes and flags based on ItemTypes using getItemType() where available in source code (`Item::Create_OTBM`). Replace or implement missing Type properties for now so these are known directly by `Item` to handle conversions based on actual server IDs in .otb if needed rather than special ID ranges - as Item now will manage all complex types from items.h/items.cpp (Teleport etc.)
