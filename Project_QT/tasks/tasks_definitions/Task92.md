**Task92: Port SpawnItem code from Map Display**
. Update or replace where those special markers (on tiles/items, likely using new dedicated marker now) like the ones spawns.cpp does to indicate range should be now visualized when rendering tile view rather than it directly handling drawing on `map-tiles`. Ensure all drawing flags like those set on spawns get replaced when now Brushes do them (rather than setting tileset from those if they are on `Selection`), which means update for TileItems as these got created after Brush has been applied to keep state and any functions requiring their flags now up-to-date based on which type tiles/items should have with borderization logic now done before setting if tiles no longer determine border status (was in update\_flags similar to modified now on `tiles`).
