**Task28: Add Initial Placeholder Renderers (Map, Tile, Item)**
* Implement placeholder rendering of map, tiles, and items in the scene until proper sprite drawing. Add necessary rendering methods if needed in `project_qt` mapdrawer with the correct basic look if they must have placeholders using `QRectF` if bounding box information was drawn around `Items`/`Tiles`/etc for debugging.
