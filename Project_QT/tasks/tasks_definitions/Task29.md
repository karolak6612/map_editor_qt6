**Task29: Begin Transition of Key Event Handling in MapCanvas and Menus.**
- Migrate core key event handling using QKeyEvent for basic operations from original (arrow keys for view movement if mapped that way in original code), keypress processing in MapCanvas if required and any keyboard commands tied specifically there from Mouse capture state or key handling functions; any basic `zoomIn`/`zoomOut` via control and +/- hotkeys that would typically call to main map or mapwindow/canvas events rather than special editor global keyboard accelerators as that code was directly for responding to View changes. Also move key event parsing or basic state detection (`isShiftDown` to using `QKeyEvent` properties as wxKeyEvent used explicit methods), any keys specific to canvas, and delegate if needed selection operations like rotate, flip or any menu accelerators to dedicated command handlers at MapCanvas level so that Qt map can later support all main events, but maintain the structure to propagate from there to actions. These can trigger dummy Actions if not needed directly for map interactions at canvas if they require dedicated keyboard press handling when used as "tools" themselves for selection manipulation but do NOT require events to be emitted outside `MapCanvas`/`MainWindow`. Ensure key events also pass QKeyEvent pointer, like MapView was using in method signatures in mouse/key events (`mousePressEvent`).
