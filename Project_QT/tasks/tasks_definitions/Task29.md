**Task29: Begin Transition of Key Event Handling in `MapCanvas` and Menus (Core Navigation, Zoom, Basic Command Invocation)**
- Task: **Migrate core key event handling logic from `wxwidgets` (primarily from `MapCanvas` and any global key handlers affecting map view interaction) to their Qt equivalents in `project_qt` using `QKeyEvent`. This task sets up the foundation for keyboard-based map interaction and command invocation.**
    - **Analyze Existing Key Handlers:** Review `Project_QT/src`'s `MapView` (or equivalent) for any existing `keyPressEvent`/`keyReleaseEvent` handlers and integrate new logic smoothly.
    - **Core `MapView` Key Events:** Implement `MapView::keyPressEvent(QKeyEvent* event)` to handle:
        -   **View Movement:** Arrow keys for panning/scrolling the map view. If the original used other keys (e.g., WASD), port that logic.
        -   **Zoom Operations:** Standard shortcuts like Ctrl + Plus (`Qt::Key_Plus`), Ctrl + Minus (`Qt::Key_Minus`) if these directly invoked zoom methods on the map view object itself (rather than being menu actions only).
        -   **Mode-Specific Keys:** If `MapCanvas` had different key behaviors based on its current state (e.g., a drawing mode, selection mode), implement stubs for this state-dependent key processing.
        -   **Mouse Capture Interaction:** Port any key press logic that was specifically tied to `MapCanvas` having mouse capture.
    - **Modifier Key State:** Convert checks like `wxKeyEvent::ShiftDown()`, `ControlDown()`, `AltDown()` to use `QKeyEvent::modifiers()` (e.g., `event->modifiers() & Qt::ShiftModifier`).
    - **Menu Accelerators & Command Delegation:**
        -   Ensure `QAction`s created for the menu (Task 8) and toolbar (Task 9) have their shortcuts (`QKeySequence`) correctly set.
        -   The `triggered()` signal of these `QAction`s should connect to placeholder slots in `MainWindow` or dedicated action/command handler classes.
        -   If specific key presses in `MapCanvas` were direct shortcuts for actions that didn't have explicit menu items but were context-dependent (e.g., 'R' to rotate selection if selection tool active), these should also delegate to the same placeholder command handler stubs.
    - **Event Propagation:** Key events should be accepted (`event->accept()`) if handled by `MapView` to prevent further propagation if necessary, or ignored (`event->ignore()`) to allow parent widgets or other handlers to process them.
    - **Structure:** The goal is to ensure that key events are captured, essential `QKeyEvent` properties are correctly read, and these events begin to trigger conceptual map interactions or placeholder command/action invocations. Full command implementation is later.
    - **`Task29.md` is crucial for identifying all specific key bindings from the original `wxwidgets` application (both direct `MapCanvas` handlers and menu/toolbar accelerators), the states in which they were active, and the methods/actions they invoked. This includes specific key names and modifier combinations.**
