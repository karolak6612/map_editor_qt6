**Task27: Create Initial `GameSprite` class.**
- Begin implementing a core `GameSprite` data container/renderer/animation handler in Project_QT, extracting code structure and minimal set of features to maintain data, handling rendering into a single frame DC for icon view/simplified representation at this time (without item template/mount drawing support in initial form as it's much simpler this way without Outfit components in GamesSprite implementation); store base attributes if loaded for quick query and handle initial `Animator` object usage by GameSprite as in wxWidgets version. Ensure sprite caching mechanisms and any other initial state of GameSprite to maintain its correct usage with ItemTypes, as this structure and attributes determine core rendering and which frame the editor currently uses with potentially all items or most sprites loaded initially from SPR if required in Project\_QT and when Item class's Draw method needs this info after sprite or graphics has been assigned to `ItemType`. Also handle the 'DrawHeight', 'drawOffset' attributes, these will eventually need data but migrate how it stored them so it's clear how to later set on instance, using a similar struct to `SpriteLight`. Store animation durations per-frame in 'Animator' if it should have direct control using it in Qt version. Ensure sprite unloading logic is adapted if `GameSprite` now handles sprite image destruction during editor closure in qt6 project and unloading resources like from opengl.
