**Task27: Create Initial `GameSprite` class (Data, Animation Stubs, Basic Rendering, Core Attributes)**
- Task: **Begin comprehensive implementation of the `GameSprite` class in `Project_QT`, inheriting from `Sprite` (Task 25). This class is the primary data container, renderer, and animation handler for all in-game visual assets (items, creatures, effects).**
    - **Analyze Existing `GameSprite` Structures:** If `Project_QT/src` has any `GameSprite` or game asset display logic, this task will integrate with or replace it.
    - **Core Data Members:** Extract and implement the structure for essential data from `wxwidgets GameSprite` (and related animation/sprite data classes). This includes:
        -   Sprite sheet reference (e.g., `QPixmap` or `QImage` for the texture atlas).
        -   Frame dimensions, number of frames, frame patterns (for different animations like idle, walk, attack).
        -   Animation layers/parts (if creatures/items have composite sprites, e.g., body, head, weapon - even if only conceptually at this stage).
        -   Durations per animation/frame.
        -   Attributes: `DrawHeight`, `drawOffset` (critical for correct positioning), `SpriteLight` struct (if used for lighting info), blend modes, etc.
    - **`Animator` Object Integration (Initial):** If `wxwidgets GameSprite` used an `Animator` object (or similar logic for managing animation state and timing):
        -   Create a basic `Animator` class structure in Qt (if not already started). It should at least manage current animation, current frame index, and timing for frame transitions (stubs for detailed logic).
        -   Ensure `GameSprite` holds and uses an instance of this `Animator`.
        -   Store animation durations per-frame within `Animator` if it had direct control.
    - **Basic `drawTo()` Rendering:** Implement the `drawTo(QPainter* painter, ...)` method to render a single, specified animation frame of the `GameSprite`. Initially, this might not handle complex multi-part drawing or mounts, focusing on a single visual representation for icon views or simplified map display.
    - **Sprite Caching & Loading Stubs:** Implement conceptual sprite caching mechanisms if part of `GameSprite`'s design. Add stubs for how `GameSprite` data would be loaded from game files (e.g., .SPR, .DAT, or sprite definition files), which will be fully implemented by `SpriteManager` (Task 35).
    - **Resource Unloading:** Implement the `unload()` method for `GameSprite` to correctly release its graphical resources (e.g., `QPixmap`s), especially important if these are loaded from custom game formats or OpenGL textures (if that was used and needs mapping to Qt image objects).
    - **`SpriteLight` Struct:** Migrate the `SpriteLight` struct and how its data (color, intensity, radius) was stored and conceptually applied to sprites.
    - **Usage Context:** This `GameSprite` structure is essential for the `Item` class's `draw()` method (Task 54) to access visual information once a sprite/graphics ID has been assigned to an `ItemType`.
    - **`Task27.md` is crucial: it must provide the detailed structure of the original `GameSprite`, `Animator`, `SpriteLight`, and any other related helper classes from `wxwidgets`, how animation data (patterns, durations, layers) was organized, and how initial attributes were loaded or queried for rendering.**
