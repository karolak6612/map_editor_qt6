**Task51: Data Serialization for `Map` (OTBM/XML/JSON)**
- Implement functions for map data serialization/deserialization. Support otbm (using `NodeFileWriteHandle`), XML, and JSON if `wxwidgets::iomap_otbm.cpp`, etc implies those are possible when writing/loading/parsing Tile/Map items (which is typically after conversion finishes for the version detected). These must be full conversions from data model using existing mechanisms for `Item` rather than Map handling on its own using internal helpers. Consider chunking logic or existing otbm file read if binary map files already support that (which simplifies writing these for Tile based chunks or other Map data as those contain a full rectangle by their very definition which otbm already did during `WxTileArea` node loading using recursion into nested or multi-floor map as done when the format allows) though how mapdata gets converted based on the original maps client version when creating/replacing Tile/Map elements seems a postprocessing step rather than directly using file I/O or Item property read to store Tile's data based on where exactly (in createTile? tile changed listeners etc. using Action/Batch classes if these hold complete tile/item structures from Wx source or QDataStream data should pass entire contents even if `Tile`/Item reads these in multiple passes) and in which steps/via which function (is Item placed fully when `map::SetTile` is called or on each attribute add/set operation etc using a method from Item->serialize) and who calls what methods to determine properties for this item on map from where. Any property setting will imply modification status setting in Qt projects `Map`/Editor/Undo stack like the wxTiles does at `set*/removeXXXItem` as thats considered map/editor changed that the host would want to commit with auto saving/send operation logic based on current server-side editor functionality. Update tile modified state, add modify() to QTile. Add save and open logic to the Map class.
