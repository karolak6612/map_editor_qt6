**Task6: Brush class transition (Subclass Structures & Core Mouse Event Handler Stubs)**
- Task: **Refactor `Brush` subclasses (such as, but not limited to, `NormalBrush`, `EraserBrush`, and others specified in `Task6.md`) into full, separate classes in `project_qt`.**
    - **Analyze Existing `Brush` Hierarchy:** If a base `Brush` class or interface already exists in `Project_QT/src` (e.g., from Task 36 if executed prior, or pre-existing code), ensure these new subclasses correctly inherit from it and are prepared to implement its required virtual methods.
    - **Core Mouse Event Handler Stubs:** For each subclass, implement the appropriate *stub* mouse event handler methods using Qt's event system. If the `MapView` uses `QGraphicsScene`, these would typically be overrides for methods interacting with `QGraphicsSceneMouseEvent` if brushes are themselves `QGraphicsItem`s or interact with items. If brushes are more abstract tools managed by `MapView`, then `MapView`'s own mouse events (`mousePressEvent`, `mouseMoveEvent`, `mouseReleaseEvent`) will delegate to the active brush. These brush methods should, for this task:
        -   Correctly receive event data (e.g., mouse position, button state).
        -   Contain placeholder logic to identify the target map tile(s) based on the event position and the brush's properties (like size, shape â€“ stubs for now if these properties aren't defined yet).
        -   Log the brush type, event type, and target tile(s) to demonstrate the event was received and processed conceptually.
    - **Deferred Functionality:** The *actual* drawing or item creation/modification logic within these brush event handlers is deferred to later tasks when `Item`, `Tile`, and `Map` modification commands are more fully implemented. The focus here is on establishing the correct class structure for each brush type and the signatures/initial processing logic for their interaction with mouse events on a conceptual map canvas.
    - **Refer to `Task6.md` for a list of specific brush subclasses from `wxwidgets` to port and any initial properties or state they should manage, as well as guidance on the expected event flow from `MapView` to the active brush.**
