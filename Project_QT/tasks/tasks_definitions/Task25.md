**Task25: Create Basic Sprite Class in Qt**
- Implement the abstract base `Sprite` class (including protected members if this used polymorphism/base copy-assignment mechanisms) to hold graphical sprite information and a DrawTo method for rendering. Implement `unloadDC` for resource cleanup using Qt-style memory/resource management, and a basic `drawTo` to serve as fallback renderer, which takes standard Draw parameters like size, dimensions (startX, startY, width, height, rotation if relevant or later from brush). Define enum for sizes or store directly, similar to SPRITE_SIZE\_XXX (32x32, 64x64, etc. if those affect rendering)
