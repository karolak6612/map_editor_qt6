**Task19: Port wxwidgets Spawn code to Project_QT and adjust links.**
- Add Spawn system code to Project_QT based on the provided wxwidgets spawn.cpp/h. Create simple QDialog to edit/configure spawn details (type, radius). Hook this up with both the map selection to view info, and right click to spawn editor if spawn present, also allow Spawn info modification with brush when selected from the creatures tab in a safe manner, updating the current map view where those appear if Spawn display is active when map changes or similar to preserve existing spawn points (on tiles). The map instance should update via an AddSpawn/removeSpawn functions so other display elements have an easy point of checking for updates as this seems to affect multiple aspects at the same time for spawns on map.
