**Task19: Port `wxwidgets` Spawn code to `Project_QT` and adjust links (Core Data, Basic Dialog, `Map` Stubs)**
- Task: **Add `Spawn` system core code to `Project_QT` based on the provided `wxwidgets spawn.cpp/h` files.**
    - **Analyze Existing `Spawn` Code:** Review and integrate with any existing `Spawn` related data structures or UI in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **`Spawn` Data Structure:** Migrate the `Spawn` data structure itself, preserving all its attributes (e.g., creature type list, radius, interval, count, position).
    - **Basic Editor `QDialog`:** Create a simple `QDialog` to view and edit/configure basic spawn details (type, radius, etc.). Initially, this dialog will not be interactively linked to the map for placement or live updates.
    - **Conceptual `Map` Links (Stubs):**
        -   The `Map` instance should provide placeholder functions like `Map::addSpawn(const Spawn& spawn)` and `Map::removeSpawn(const Spawn& spawn)`. These allow other systems to notionally update the map's spawn data.
        -   `MapView` (or its `MapCanvas` equivalent) should have placeholder logic for how it might receive spawn information if a spawn is selected on the map (e.g., a right-click context menu option "Edit Spawn" which would show the dialog).
    - **Conceptual "Spawn Brush" Interaction:** Include placeholder logic indicating how spawn information could be modified with a "spawn brush" when selected from a "creatures tab" (this interaction is largely conceptual at this stage). The key is that the `Spawn` object itself should be modifiable, and the `Map` should have a way to be informed of changes.
    - **Visual Updates (Deferred):** Defer actual visual updates in `MapView` when spawn points are added/modified on tiles; focus on the data structures and basic editing dialog. The `Map` update functions (`addSpawn`/`removeSpawn`) are important stubs for later systems (like `MapView` or command history) to call.
    - **`Task19.md` should provide the full structure of the `Spawn` object from `wxwidgets`, details of the original spawn editing UI, and how spawns were associated with tiles or map locations.**
