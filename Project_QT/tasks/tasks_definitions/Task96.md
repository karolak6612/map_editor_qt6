**Task96: Implement Key Forwarding, Navigation, and Input Handling for All Palettes/Dialog Controls**
: Handle focus changes appropriately so other map controls don't intercept using shortcuts if some wxWidget input event for keyboard is passed to active MapCanvas now but should not be for every Key\_press there unless some special tool states are set that are modified when typing text into for instance `search_field`, and that a change on `ItemPropertyWindow`/editor would not need a `EVT_CHAR`/KeyEvent as theres now `focus/buttonclicked/keypress event` handlers and Qt slots for those UI widgets rather than intercepting specific events as input; adapt `wxNumberTextCtrl` if those handle via key\_down as numberinput events if its value/key updates from there (`changeValue`/other actions on controls should propagate only if their data has been validated, or a setProperty is used to indicate PropertyEditor to do its thing on Tiles/Items which update display items like in main or other instances if theres now specific property type update via a command using map rather than tile-layer/group setting for these like in Brushs/findSimilar implementation before) as tiles also require additional checks, or signals in these like the way Item has for attributes etc which also ideally trigger a refresh like `wxCommandEvent` in Update for properties view if no `undoStack`.  Also migrate all `itemProperties` changes similar to house editors from its OnOK using the correct values/types.
