**Task86: Migrate and Refactor the `Town` and `House` System (Enhanced)**
- Task: Enhance the Town and House management system with improved editing capabilities and UI integration. Migrate the remaining logic related to houses and towns including menu actions, tools (house/town editors, waypoint placement) which likely used some Tile specific calls previously for properties. Handle events using `QGraphicsItem` properties where selection triggers highlighting or context menus for items of type house. Handle complex map->tiles manipulation where existing house tiles might get changed at multiple `floor`/locations from different `wx` windows like before but now update if theres house/town change after that like when loading them from `XML/otbm`, including cleanup methods when there no more dedicated `houses` structure in `map->tiles`, or its Item based management (`TilesetHouse`). If there's no current equivalent of House properties editor, maintain current edit, add, and related update (`buildListBox`, using selection for editing the item in question as Map or Mainwindow seem now the target of editing logic calls), updating display list as changes occurred unless theres signals triggered directly when a house properties are edited or those happen within dedicated panel on `propertyEditorDock`/`MapView` selection, creating appropriately TileItems from updated positions like similar operations such as find in result window does or tile properties now being edited. Consider actions like `HouseExitChange` which update where relevant if done by tools or in current selection, as a `wxTile` no longer contains that using methods but `ItemProperties` that ideally maintain state where houseId, spawn marker state is also present, adding functions to set any associated item/attribute/tile and not via dedicated set rather when the operation implies those should be done. For now focus on completing the logic for both the `House` and `Town` object handling similar to earlier migrations rather than making dedicated menu items as it isn't clear if those now simply belong under a property page on tabs as these house-tiles themselves or a completely different part if they interact mainly only using map, tiles in the edit actions. If `house->setExit` only modify map, no tile needs explicit events or functions.
