**Task26: Create EditorSprite and its initial renderer**
- Create `EditorSprite` to use image files from resources or paths passed if this also needs dynamically loaded images similar to how other parts may handle image caching in wxWidgets (either using standard xpm resources if there were bundled static images in Editor or PNG etc., adapting these to ensure scaling from different resources when initializing like before via ResourceManager or from relative locations if resources.qrc mechanism to load editor graphics is desired and available) - handling memory DC in `wxwidgets::gfx.cpp`  via `drawTo()` implementation, for use by internal tools and buttons which seems the primary case (no specific items or sprites from the games client but more editor visual information only if this was the distinction from other types and EditorSprites where never dynamically instantiated) if Sprite doesn't manage it on its own but these have some custom initialization or format (and how sprites used EditorGraphics like cursor items handled it in the palette for display from editor graphics, though these could just point to Item icons once Items have theirs as a basic approach for static graphics on editors internal sprites); also maintain separate member variables or structure so Draw method knows its correct size for editor buttons at fixed resolution (similar to RENDER_SIZE\_16x16 or RenderMode) while adapting from multiple or handling drawing like original source to the passed RenderMode when rendering into Qt widget using passed device context.
