**Task26: Create `EditorSprite` and its initial renderer (Full UI Sprite Implementation)**
- Task: **Create the `EditorSprite` class, inheriting from the abstract `Sprite` class (Task 25), specifically for sprites used within the editor's UI (buttons, cursors, tool icons, static graphics from editor resources), as distinct from game asset sprites.**
    - **Analyze Existing UI Sprite Handling:** Review how editor UI graphics are handled in `Project_QT/src` and integrate or refactor.
    - **Image Loading:** `EditorSprite` should handle loading its images from:
        -   Qt's resource system (`.qrc` files) for bundled static images (XPM, PNG, etc.).
        -   Filesystem paths if some editor graphics are dynamically loaded.
        -   Adapt these to use `QPixmap` or `QImage` for internal storage.
    - **`drawTo()` Implementation:** Implement the `drawTo(QPainter* painter, ...)` method to render the loaded image using `QPainter`. This logic replaces `wxMemoryDC` drawing from `wxwidgets::gfx.cpp` for editor graphics.
    - **Resource Management:** `EditorSprite` is responsible for managing the memory of its loaded `QPixmap`/`QImage`. Implement its `unload()` method correctly.
    - **Sizing and Rendering Modes:**
        -   Handle different fixed resolutions if original `EditorGraphics` had specific `RENDER_SIZE_16x16` or `RenderMode` for drawing on editor buttons or UI elements at fixed sizes.
        -   The `drawTo()` method should be able to adapt its rendering based on a passed target rectangle or a `RenderMode` parameter if such a concept needs to be preserved from the original source (as per `Task26.md`).
    - **Distinction from `GameSprite`:** This sprite is NOT for game client assets but for the editor's own visual elements, especially if `EditorSprite`s were never dynamically instantiated from game data but loaded from editor-specific resources.
    - **Cursor Item Graphics:** Address how sprites for cursor items displayed in palettes (if these were distinct `EditorSprite`s) are handled. (These could later potentially just point to `Item` icons once `Item`s have full sprite support).
    - **`Task26.md` provides details on specific image sources (e.g., bundled XPMs), names, sizes, any existing `RenderMode` enums, and how `wxwidgets` handled drawing these editor-specific graphics.**
