**Task38: Migrate `GroundBrush` (Terrain Subtype)**
-   Create `GroundBrush`, inheriting from `TerrainBrush` adding core functions from wxwidgets (border and tile properties) ensuring proper save/load format if stored by its own name in .xml; replace border type checks (isBorder, BORDER\_XXX) with dynamic cast if necessary at `draw()` methods. Integrate with border system for appropriate border application after drawing to the new tile using current parameters from `Brush` rather than checking against what seems a list from a GUI component for all neighbouring locations if possible using some method provided by either Map, View or similar if `draw`/`unDraw` simply indicates Tile needs updating and those functions in BorderSystem are meant for re-evaluating surroundings after tile modification when there is any content (even without an active selection). For other members or brush specific states like `ground_equivalent` check `item.cpp`, if those seem handled only at Tile placement level there then just keep how that logic in source reads rather than setting attributes on GroundBrush itself.
