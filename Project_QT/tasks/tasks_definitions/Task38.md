**Task38: Migrate `GroundBrush` (Terrain Subtype - Item Placement & Border System Hook Placeholders)**
- Task: **Create the `GroundBrush` class in `project_qt`, ensuring it inherits from `TerrainBrush` (Task 37). This brush is responsible for placing ground items/textures.**
    - **Analyze Existing `GroundBrush`:** Refactor or complete any existing `GroundBrush` in `Project_QT/src`.
    - **Core Functions from `wxwidgets`:** Port essential functionalities related to ground placement and its interaction with tile properties, as detailed in `Task38.md`.
    - **Saving/Loading Properties:** If `GroundBrush` had specific properties stored in `.xml` (e.g., preferred ground item ID), ensure the class structure can hold these (actual save/load is Task 81).
    - **`draw(Map* map, const QPoint& tilePos, Item* currentItem)` Implementation:**
        -   This method should now conceptually set a specific "ground item" on the target `Tile` at `tilePos`. This might involve:
            -   Determining the `ItemType` or ID of the ground to place (e.g., from `currentItem` if the brush is "loaded" with a specific ground type, or from `GroundBrush`'s internal properties).
            -   Creating a placeholder call to `map->setGroundItem(tilePos, groundItemID)`. (Actual `Tile` modification by `Map` is implemented later).
    - **Border System Interaction (Placeholders):**
        -   The placement of ground often triggers border calculations. While the full `BorderSystem` (Task 52) is implemented later, `GroundBrush::draw()` should include placeholder calls or signals indicating that borders may need recalculation for the affected `tilePos` and its neighbors. For example, `map->requestBorderUpdate(tilePos)`.
        -   Replace direct `isBorder` checks or `BORDER_XXX` usage from `wxwidgets` draw methods with these conceptual calls or by setting flags on the `Tile` that the `BorderSystem` will later interpret.
    - **`ground_equivalent` Handling:** If logic related to `ground_equivalent` (from `wxwidgets item.cpp`) affects ground placement (e.g., certain grounds can only be placed next to equivalents), incorporate this check into `canDraw()` or the `draw()` method of `GroundBrush`. This logic should now use `Item` properties or types, not just `Tile` placement-level checks if possible.
    - **`Task38.md` needs to detail the specific properties of `GroundBrush`, how it determined the ground item to place, its exact interaction points with border logic (even if conceptual at this stage), and how `ground_equivalent` was handled in `wxwidgets`.**
