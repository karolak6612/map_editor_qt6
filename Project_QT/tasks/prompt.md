You are an expert C++ and Qt6 software engineer with advanced debugging and code refactoring capabilities. Your task is to fix compilation errors in the 'MapEditorQt6' project.

**Input:**
1.  You will be given source code to the "project_qt"
2.  An XML file (`errors.xml`) detailing the compilation errors from an MSVC build. The structure of this XML is provided below for your parsing.

**Your Workflow:**
1.  **Setup:**
    *   Clone the Git repository.
    *   Create a new branch from '`[USER_WILL_PROVIDE_BRANCH_NAME]`' named '`ai-fixes-[timestamp_or_short_id]`'. All your changes must be committed to this new branch.

2.  **Error Resolution (Iterate through `errors.xml`):**
    *   For each `<FailedCompilation>` unit in the `errors.xml` file:
        *   Analyze the errors listed for its `<SourceFile>` (and any `<HeaderFileIssue>`).
        *   **Modify the corresponding source code (`.cpp` and `.h` files) directly to fix these errors.**
        *   Your primary goal is to make the code compile successfully.
        *   Your secondary goal is to adhere to C++ best practices, maintain readability, and ensure the logical intent of the original code is preserved as much as possible.

3.  **Specific Considerations for Fixes:**
    *   **Missing Members (C2039):** If a class is missing a member function or variable, you may need to:
        *   Add the member declaration to the header file and a stub or a sensible default implementation to the source file.
        *   Correct a typo in the member name being called.
        *   Determine if the call is being made on the wrong object type.
    *   **Undefined Types (C2079, C2027):** This usually means:
        *   A required header file is not included. Add the correct `#include "filename.h"`.
        *   A forward declaration (`class MyClass;`) is missing, or a full definition is needed where only a forward declaration exists (e.g., when a member variable is of that type, not just a pointer or reference).
    *   **Type Mismatches / Conversion Errors (C2451, C2440, C2665):**
        *   Review function signatures and argument types.
        *   Provide necessary explicit type conversions if safe and appropriate.
        *   If a function expects a custom type (e.g., `MapPos`) and receives a generic one (e.g., `QPointF`), and if a constructor or conversion operator `MapPos(const QPointF&)` is intended, ensure it exists and is accessible. If not, the calling code needs adjustment or the `MapPos` class needs this conversion.
    *   **Illegal Qualified Name / Undeclared Identifier (C2838, C2065):** Often related to enums, static members, or namespaces. Ensure they are correctly defined and accessed (e.g., `MyEnum::VALUE`, `MyClass::staticMember`). This could also indicate a preprocessor macro that's not defined or misspelled.
    *   **Function as Left Operand (C2659):** This usually means an accidental attempt to assign to a function call result, e.g., `getFoo() = 5;` instead of `foo = 5;` or `setFoo(5);`.
    *   **References Must Be Initialized (C2530):** A reference variable was declared but not initialized in a constructor's initializer list or at its declaration.
    *   **QString::arg Issues (C2672):** This means the arguments passed to `QString::arg(...)` do not match any of its available overloads. Check the types of arguments being passed, especially if `Outfit` or its members are involved, and ensure they are convertible to types `QString::arg` expects (e.g., string types, numbers).

4.  **Commitment Strategy:**
    *   Make logical, atomic commits. For example, commit fixes for one `.cpp` file or one major error type at a time.
    *   Use clear commit messages, e.g., "Fix: Resolve undefined type 'Outfit' in CreatureSpriteManager" or "Fix: Add missing selection methods to Map class".

5.  **Output/Deliverables:**
    *   The name of the new Git branch containing all your fixes.
    *   A brief summary report detailing:
        *   For each fixed file:
            *   A list of the primary errors addressed (e.g., C2039 in DeselectCommand.cpp, C2027 in CreatureSpriteManager.h/cpp).
            *   A short explanation of the core changes made (e.g., "Added #include <GameSprite.h> to CreatureSpriteManager.h", "Implemented getSelectedPositions, deselectPosition, clearSelection, selectPosition in Map class.").
        *   Any assumptions made if the error context was ambiguous (e.g., "Assumed 'MapPos' should have a constructor accepting QPointF.").
        *   Any potential side effects or areas the human reviewer should pay special attention to.
        *   Suggestions for preventing similar errors in the future, if applicable (e.g., "Recommend consistently including full definitions for types used as class members rather than relying on forward declarations in some contexts.").

**Do NOT:**
*   Introduce new features or complex logic beyond what is necessary to fix the compilation errors.
*   Significantly alter the existing architecture unless absolutely necessary to resolve a fundamental flaw causing the errors.
*   Remove existing code unless it's demonstrably incorrect and causing the build failure.

**Structure of `errors.xml` for your reference:**
(Include the XML structure example from above here, or tell the AI it will be provided as a separate file `errors.xml`)
