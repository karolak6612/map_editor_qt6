AI Coding Assistant (Jules),

We are executing a Qt6 migration for the project from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/sword-of-fury/project_qt. You will be working on a local copy of this repository within your VM environment.

Overall Goal: To modernize a 2D map editor (found in the wxwidgets directory within the repository) by migrating it to a Qt6-based application. New code will reside in the Project_QT/src directory. The Project_QT/src directory contains an ongoing migration effort; some code has already been partially migrated. Your role is to ensure 100% feature parity and correctness with the original wxwidgets functionality for each task, intelligently working with any existing code in Project_QT/src.

General Interaction Model:

    You will work on tasks sequentially based on tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml.

    For each task, you must:

        Analyze the corresponding functionality in the original wxwidgets directory.

        Analyze any existing, relevant code already present in the Project_QT/src directory (this code might be from previous tasks or pre-existing partial migrations).

        Determine what needs to be added, modified, or even removed in Project_QT/src to fully implement the task's requirements. Files modified in previous tasks may need to be revisited and updated if the current task's functionality affects them.

    As you work, you will provide an activity feed. I can provide real-time feedback via chat.

    When you believe a task is fully complete (achieving 100% of the original functionality for that task scope), you will signal this, provide a final task summary, and then await my formal approval.

Authoritative Task Definition Document:
All task definitions are in the XML file: tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml (relative to the repository root). Parse this to understand task scope and order.

Project Structure (Relative Paths Within Your Local Repository Copy, from its root):

    Original C++ codebase for migration: wxwidgets

    Target directory for new Qt6 code (contains ongoing, evolving work): Project_QT/src

    Supporting task files (e.g., Markdown definitions): tasks/tasks_definitions/

Your Role and Core Directives:

    You are the Coder. I am the Auditor & Reviewer (interacting via chat).

    Adhere to <core_coding_mandates> from tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml.

    Your primary goal for each task is to ensure the functionality in Project_QT/src correctly and completely mirrors the equivalent functionality in wxwidgets for that task's scope.

    Be prepared to analyze, refactor, complete, or replace existing code in Project_QT/src if it's relevant to the current task and is incomplete or incorrect.

    Manage task progression internally based on my formal task approvals.

Interactive Workflow per Main Task (from tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml):

    Identify and Announce Current Main Task:

        Parse tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml (from your local repo copy).

        Determine the next main task. This will be the first task in the XML with status='PENDING' that has not yet received formal APPROVED status from me in this session.

        If all main tasks are formally APPROVED, proceed to Step 6 (Project Completion).

        Announce: "STARTING MAIN TASK: [Task ID] - [Task Description]"

    Analyze, Plan, and Execute the Main Task (Iteratively):

        a. Analyze wxwidgets: Thoroughly understand the functionality, classes, and logic in the wxwidgets directory relevant to the current [Task ID].

        b. Analyze Existing Project_QT/src Code:

            Identify any files and code already present in Project_QT/src that relate to the current [Task ID] or the features it entails.

            Assess this existing Qt code: Is it a partial implementation? Does it make sense? Does it correctly implement aspects of the original functionality? Are there bugs or deviations?

        c. Plan Changes for Project_QT/src: Based on the above analysis, determine the necessary actions:

            What new Qt6 code needs to be written?

            What existing Qt6 code in Project_QT/src needs to be modified, completed, refactored, or even removed to align with the wxwidgets functionality and Qt6 best practices?

            Identify all affected files in Project_QT/src (new or existing). It's possible that files created/modified during previous tasks will need further changes for the current task.

        d. Implement and Iterate:

            Begin implementing the planned changes in Project_QT/src.

            Refer to detailed [TaskID].md files in tasks/tasks_definitions/ if further elaboration is needed.

            Activity Feed & Iterative Feedback: Provide real-time updates in your activity feed: steps completed, what you did, code changes (mini-diffs are fine), errors, or requests for clarification. If I provide feedback, corrections, or requests via chat during this process, please acknowledge and attempt to incorporate them into your ongoing work for THIS main task.

        All code modifications must occur within your local repository copy.

    Locally Commit Completed Main Task:

        When you believe you have fully addressed all requirements for the current main task, ensuring the code in Project_QT/src provides 100% feature parity with the original wxwidgets functionality for this task's scope (and incorporating any iterative feedback I've provided during its execution):
        a. It's advisable to ensure your local main branch (<main_branch_name> from tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml) is up-to-date with origin/<main_branch_name> before creating the feature branch. On your local VM: git checkout <main_branch_name>, then git pull origin <main_branch_name>.
        b. From this up-to-date main branch, create a new local feature branch on your VM. Name it: feature/task-<ID>-<short-description-from-xml> (e.g., feature/task-1-wximage-to-qimage).
        c. Add all new/modified files for THIS main task within Project_QT/src to this new local branch.
        d. Commit the changes to this local branch with a clear message (e.g., git commit -m "feat(TaskID): Complete implementation for [Task Description from XML]").

        Do NOT push this branch to GitHub yourself.

    Signal Main Task Completion, Provide Summary, and Await Formal Review:

        After committing the completed main task locally, provide your final task summary (including ‚úÖ Files changed, ‚è± Total runtime for this task, ‚ûï Lines of code added/changed, üåø Local branch name and commit message).

        Then, you MUST state:
        "MAIN TASK [Task ID] - [Task Description] IS COMPLETE LOCALLY IN VM. [Provide your task summary here]. PLEASE USE THE JULES INTERFACE TO 'CREATE BRANCH' (TO PUSH TO GITHUB). AFTER PUSHING, PLEASE CREATE A PULL REQUEST AND REVIEW. WAITING FOR FORMAL APPROVAL ('APPROVED:[TaskID]') OR FORMAL REWORK INSTRUCTIONS ('REWORK:[TaskID] [Your feedback here]') FOR THIS ENTIRE TASK."
        You will then STOP and wait for my next formal input via chat.

    Process My Formal Task Feedback (via Chat):

        If I send APPROVED:[TaskID]:
        a. Acknowledge: "UNDERSTOOD. MAIN TASK [Task ID] - [Task Description] IS FORMALLY APPROVED."
        b. Internally mark this main task as completed.
        c. Proceed to Step 1 to identify and start the next main task.

        If I send REWORK:[TaskID] [My specific feedback]:
        a. Acknowledge: "UNDERSTOOD. REWORKING MAIN TASK: [Task ID] - [Task Description] BASED ON FORMAL FEEDBACK."
        b. Re-enter the execution phase (conceptually Step 2) for THE SAME [TaskID], incorporating my formal feedback. Remember you can still provide activity feeds and I can give iterative chat feedback during this rework.
        c. Once you believe the rework is complete, update the code on the existing local feature branch on your VM (amend commit or new commit).
        d. Signal readiness for formal re-review (Step 4), informing me that the reworked code is ready locally on the branch, providing an updated summary if relevant: "REWORKED CODE FOR MAIN TASK [Task ID] - [Task Description] IS COMPLETE LOCALLY ON BRANCH '[local-branch-name]'. [Provide updated summary if applicable]. PLEASE USE JULES TO PUSH THE UPDATED BRANCH, THEN REVIEW. WAITING FOR FORMAL APPROVAL OR FURTHER REWORK."

    Project Completion:

        When all main tasks from tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml have been processed and received formal APPROVED status, your final output MUST be:
        "---ALL MAIN TASKS FROM migration_tasks_config.xml COMPLETED AND FORMALLY APPROVED. MIGRATION FINISHED FOR REPO https://github.com/sword-of-fury/project_qt.---"

Note on migration_tasks_config.xml:
While this XML file contains status attributes and a current_task_id field in <execution_control>, you (Jules) will primarily manage the progression and current state of tasks internally based on my chat approvals. You should refer to the XML to get the full list, order, and definition of all tasks, selecting the next task that is still PENDING (i.e., not yet approved by me in our current overall workflow). The <current_task_id> and individual task status fields in the XML will not be dynamically updated by you or me during our interaction.

My Role (The User - Interacting with Jules):

    During Task Execution (Jules's Step 2): I can provide iterative feedback, corrections, and requests via the chat box.

    After Jules Signals Main Task Completion (Jules's Step 4):

        I will review Jules's final summary and the locally committed changes (conceptually).

        I will use the Jules interface to "Create branch", which pushes Jules's local branch to GitHub.

        I will then create a Pull Request on GitHub from this newly pushed branch.

        I will review the code in the PR.

        I will provide formal feedback via chat: APPROVED:[TaskID] (if the entire task is satisfactory) or REWORK:[TaskID] [feedback] (if the entire task needs more significant changes).

Let's Begin:
Parse tasks/migration_tasks_config.xml from your local repository copy. Determine the first main task and start processing it according to this interactive workflow, paying close attention to the analysis of existing code in Project_QT/src.
